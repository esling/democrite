42! !
frankly I'll be honest, Chouard he's a good guy he has ideas but he is indoctrinated by his extreme right friends when he begins to speak of borders we sense that goes beyond its subject, criticizing globalism it is one thing but you have put your finger on specific items to get out of the fog. by cons I recognize that it has merit to invest in its cause. finally good because you stop talking about it, all is not throwing as many find common issues
ð 2
Take a seat, anthony, settle down comfortably .. Is not a subject that is not debate here ð
I am comfortably thank you, haha.
All is not good to take home Chouard, certainly. Then keep only what brings us ð
Sent, I hardly supports the inaccuracies then I will not let what I see: Etienne Chouard's borders especially in reading Debray "Praise border" which has nothing to do with a quote " right-wing indoctrination. "
@Reveur And what topics you that drives you?
ð 1
me what bothers me is that countries such as France benefiting from weak currencies (eg in Africa) to steal the resources of this country. what bothers me is that the last section of the preamble 46 is still not respected (CFA franc etc.) while it was inspired by a speech of 44 and the blood flowed, Africa has sacrificed his son for Europe and France and today they are treated as a sub-continent and me it gives me the creeps
Freedom of expression. I watched the debate between firstly the economist and philosopher Frédéric Lordon and secondly anthropologist David Graeber. I was impressed by their difference in that Lordon seemed to have a kind of political program (end of private ownership of means of production, for example) while Graeber simply wanted "to be left to the people to speak."
@Reveur Yes that is what I say it critical for the eu borders too porous, as the extreme right
Jotting "as far right" allows to discredit the idea. It is a form of sophistry useful to avoid substantive debate.
xD I have to search half the words you use
ð 1
Glad to raise the level ð
Seriously, what bothers me in the first place is that there is inconsiderable number of injustices in this country. In this sense, I fully support the idea of ??convergence of struggles.
ð 1
I agree
The trouble is converging but yes to what?
The question "what to bring together the struggles?" and I bring a solution in this post: https://pouvoiraupeuple.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/le-point-de-convergence-des-luttes-mene-a-la-souverainete
 
pouvoiraupeuple.wordpress.com
The point of convergence of struggles leads to sovereignty
Frédéric Lordon said: "In France, someone who says that he is neither right nor left is invariably right, or right end. "This injunction political commentators & # 821
he is right
this is not a disease to be left in general is assumed
good this time I'm really still dsl for the inconvenience bye
Not to be desoler, byer
have a good day
The problem is that say "left" or "right" or "center" does not suggest a popular solution, because it cleaves the people. What I am advocating in this post is to put aside labels (eg I'm libertarian in terms of moral values ??but I do not put it forward because it is cleaving).
the problem is that to was in agreement must content
I do not wish to cleave a moral, but to unite on a meta-political struggle that is to say, a struggle that transcends current divisions and will allow us to unite on the type of social and institutional structures that we wish to see emerge.
A left and right there are people who want to fight against neoliberalism, respect freedom of expression, save social security.
these structures must be Dase on ideology, which has been determine
Hello

hello brother, I am going there soon ð
The only ideology that go away is one that temporarily puts aside all the others, by uniting to implement democratic meta-political structures we need.
Thank you @ Vecu.Psychologie.Paris
I just read a little up there anthony, the "end of private ownership of the means of production" is not an idea invented by Lordon, I do not know if it can reasonably qualify program
but it's that I'm not you, you can not determine "meta-democratic political structures we need" without ideological basis
"An ideology is a predefined system of ideas, also called categories, from which reality is analyzed, as opposed to an intuitive knowledge of perceived tangible reality."
@ Homer242: thank you for this definition
Allows me to be septic @Reveur. How do you succeed in extracting an ideology 'unique' by inspiring you to such thinkers: François Asselineau, Sylvain Baron, Aurélien Bernier, Olivier Berruyer, Jean Bricmont, Étienne Chouard Francis Cousin, Michel Collon, Franck Lepage Frédéric Lordon, Jacques Sapir Alain Soral?
must give power back to the people. It seems to me a sensible reality perceived by all.
Yeah @Aquabon
It's simple: I center my reflection on the meta-policy. That is to say, how one sets superior rules for operation of the democratic process.
but it was already ..
@Reveur: So write a new constitution
we are in democracy, we vote for those we want ....
I think we can not speak of "democracy" without a fundamental critique of the values ??that support it.
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: this is not a democracy, it is a plutocracy
For example, yes @ homer242
we vote for masters
those sub
Exactly, it's a plutocratic oligarchy.
those funded by wealthy
No, the system is each vote, and each vote has the same value
we use it correctly that is all
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: we vote for those that the most seen in the media
and the media guide the electoral battle
you advance the human bias
left vs. right
there are hundreds of ways to organize the votes and they influence the results.
No this is the system that is illusory. As long as we imagine voting to establish power over a majority, it will not change anything. Majorities are already based on the established power.
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: people vote as they are told
and there are mass influence techniques, I think of astroturfing (those who have access to research UNmotor be interested)
This will not change people will always suggestible
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: they are easily influenced because the system ensures that we are not interested in politics

Feel free to carry on your conversations #blabla to facilitate the arrival of newcomers ^^
I think we need a system that puts the citizen in politics
if you see the audience as victims of images dealers, suddenly, they are far less responsible ^^
ah ok I arrived, I thought it was nice to be greeted with a ð debate
Perhaps you like me to come to the conclusion that leaving the majority choose is inefficase, essential questions are asked to people who know nothing there and it is expected that the most popular answer is the right
It will work well then we would desfois do something else. This is because one is forced. If we force everyone to be active against the policy. If one is educated from childhood. It will be wall to a true democracy.
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: there's also this ... absolutely!
@ low.abstraction.besancon you see is what I suggested this idea permit vote..mais bon..ça goes wrong
not you see, it is the logical consequence to a concrete problem
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: it is to qualify but I also see more elections as a power against (someone too unpopular will not be renewed) than a real exercise of power
A last message passing: @ low.abstraction.besancon defends negative the appearance of a strong leader, which is the program of the extreme right, who tries, as we know, to direct the movement. It starts from the recognition that we share (the vote does not) to bring us to "we need a leader who knows better than the others"
@ Geoffrey.sciences.convergence.bordeaux: no, not a leader but a team dirigente ..
for me democracy is not only of all exercise our power by the state apparatus but also to limit its power and guarantee civil liberties to organize ALSO in other forms of exercise of power as a demonstration night standing.
VDSO thank you, I'm interested to me is how the françe it will coordinate and agree. Can t have overcome egos to arrive at common points of convergence in a country like ours? What tools are in place to arrive at a common coordination between the different ag?
no management team will know better than me what life, and will have access to the creativity that comes from a group of intelligence
personally I think many people in this movement limit their political vision for a reform of the state and representative system as politics and power are also outside this framework
@galaad why France should it remain as it? We have known for some time that democracy works best in smaller groups, coordinate the whole France is to launch a challenge that we will be able to deal with much more experience
Come discuss #blabla ð people
France is changing and evolving, there is today in every city people who are open ag to defend their rights, blocked the national scene, the problem and the major challenge (for me) is the coordination between all its ag and all his fights. Can you do me by your conclusions in relation to the concept works best in small groups? it is not currently creating this experience and the reason for the cat?

And to the question / cities rather than / places. The two are complementary ... A city contains places for example. I see instead (in English) as a place.

An idea submitted to consensus
Use francs
In the Constitution, stipulate that:
Citizen Bank of France only for notes and coins in francs redeemable against.
In part against the Citizens Bank of France repays the capital of the SOVEREIGN DEBT (no interest, a way to punish wear use).
The Issuing Bank controlled francs seamlessly by citizens and led to the consensus of general assemblies votes, for example.
This currency in francs, without credit card or check, that parts and against the Exchangeable Notes, promote an economy made up of peasants, artisans, small traders, independent citizens, and compete on home soil in their current use a currency that is not the black, they are francs.
Moreover, once refunded sovereign debt, which would take its meaning in a democracy, this currency issued by Citizens Bank of France would fund a social policy (socialism) under the control of citizens who could vote in general meetings the main guidelines this policy funded by francs (not so in the voting booth) and apply when doing CONSENSUS.
What do you think of this as socialism exercise of democracy?
I think we should make a great banquet and use the local currency as menhir, by cons must not prohibit the fresh fish

Basic Income - France
The basic income, a new social contract? (Arte)
I find that these idylls of France self-sufficient and cut off from the world with a closed economy it even unrealistic, less than a retreat into extreme chauvinism, to prohibit foreign trade and make a wall around the country. Enquel if you can what you want because I would have moved
I love this kind of argument, or you agreed to internationalism, or you're a freak who wants to lock you up in a bunker and never tell anyone
half measures, never heard> _ <
@lucas_dev_paris: a currency exchange. We went in after the attacks of 11 September 2001 (I think it attaches to an evil spirit). So already competing with the on its own soil, by use, it does not prevent the "trade" that can be done with other currencies, as long as the latter is accepted by of other banks, and it depends on the social credit, ie its use in society. The key is to know that we want society. I think globalism request to find limits and a currency promoting an economy of peasants, artisans, small traders, and independent (no CB or checks) would be a power-cons.
 
I would say we should do as in america post intependance. EVERY bank to its currency
whatever it is limited ..
I think this is already the case in Switzerland too. View full currency initiative to give exclusivity to the currency issue to a national bank.
yet, it'll be voted
whatever awaits
 by
yes this is the case you got the SNB which prints the private banks but the system is the same as with the Bank Europeen
If we use that come francs a Citizens Bank (managed and directed by the citizens) voluntarily (by sacrificing for the Franks) who collected with reimburses the capital of the sovereign debt, at least we know what stick: using francs we free of debt, it opens in the future

I find absurd ca to compete with the euro as another currency managed by the state. for me it is indeed one liberalizes currency or local currency is made as @stocky said either we return to the franc and leaving the euro
Varoufakis wanted to launch a plan in the genre with a Greek local currency remaining in the euro but nobody followed, in my opinion because of this fact is equivalent to leaving the euro
@lucas_dev_paris: the franc will not be managed by the state but by a French citizen bank, to see how it works (its constitution)
@ Corentin592_dev_londres: yeah when I hear back a former France small artisans and small farmers ... take switzerland, countries as international banks such ca is not credible
@lucas_dev_paris: I do not take the example of Switzerland, but thought that it develops around the full currency initiative
the problem is that out of 30 years of opening borders with the results we know
@cyrildelacour: yes but it would have a monopoly on the local currency, which would be guaranteed by the state, otherwise it is the liberalization of currency and I do not believe either you defend ca
it is being discussed on the losing Romain now such

Why is growth so necessary that we impose in the name of competitiveness at solidarity prices, it requires the sacrifice of living?
Would this not to honor the interests that fund?
This wear, as a means to parasitize the economy and as favorable to a minority principle that the passage nothing "socialist" as the foundation of capitalism, allows money to make money, not only in contempt of work, but also our social and especially so natural environment.
So to not be compelled to growth or to war, do we not outlaw usury, starting money creation?
Must still be sovereign to decide, but our democracy is deprived of sovereignty by usurpers. What do you think it causes?
To understand this we must be aware of what the value placed in the measure of all things instead of keeping measure in everything, tearing the darkness that surrounds the creation of money and why so many sacrifices are made.
Desecrate money sum.
It is not easy and even a banker shows its difficulty understanding what money is. So here's a lesson in democracy by a Swiss banker: https://youtu.be/dmwtBcU0qtA
When children fight over a toy and because I do not like lying to them: "I do not believe in Santa Claus, if the toys belong to the dispute, confiscated!" They understand and learn autonomy in setting their own conflicts. I just reminded them the function of a toy (the first property).
The first function of money was to facilitate trade, and now it is a means by usury, appropriating and reserve riches while imposing a form of slavery through debt.
In this insurrectionary period (as many prefects and for a while now, and for example with #NuitDebout movement) many slaves are ready to repress other slaves to the money, but it should not be more royalist than the King?
The fact is that cash is king, sovereign debt, the fallen people, very fallen!
This is the usurper.
We are plutocracy, we are not a democracy.
But the plutocracy can be born democracy, as the venom antidote.
Keep in mind that a tree does not sell fruits, money is not vital.
Specifically how to make money an antidote?

This is not the French bank, but the bank of AGs, nuance. ND Just look to see that the AGs are subject to the same struggles and abuse of power that the system in place.
I note that the periscope Romain Leclerc it was about (money) in Paris Republic Square just a few minutes ..)
#breakingnews radiodebout has decided to close its site, I do not know any more for the moment
So it would in addition Citizen Bank of France is decentralized (see cybernetic principles), so dependent on general meetings (plural): a new praxis
for me it would be enough to let the European Central Bank the possibility of inflation, because basically it is ca debate on austerity and independence
no need to overhaul the whole system and destroy the EU in passing in my opinion
@lucas_dev_paris: better to let the franc to citizens and usurers, these vultures!
moreover they started last year it seems to do quantitative easing
@lucas_dev_paris: I have not personally "advantage" of printing money (scriptural writings) European, but instead I see his misdeeds
@lucas_dev_paris: I do not think the only one to see it
@lucas_dev_paris: to put it simply, are cursed!
Output or not the euro, not being an economist is hard to choose. But at a minimum it would take a public debate, instead of ca we are told only that the output of the euro c is a disaster, a disaster for that? And night stand lets discuss these issues, it's been fun!
 
ok I start a topic. I heard a woman screaming on a REDIF of radiodebout on gender and the right woman. I just want to say that ca useless she screams. it will not ecouté and she knows it. then instead of shouting it should rather make them think

google why the great oracle?
It may well be good journalists, your speech is not good to hear you, we should all take is the discourse of fascists
It bothers me, it's my opinion
not false
Even good journalists must adhere to a media field in poor condition
@satanicwarmaster: no, we have to stop believing the lies broadcast on TV for example, the most effective is to have no TV ..)
 
theguardian are some nice they helped snowden xD
That does not stop to accept bias, people can judge and think for themselves, you know everyone is not stupid in this world
The problem is not journalism, but conivence with power, men of power .. The links of politicians with the bosses of the 'trusts' media. So suddenly the editorial lines are very far from what is called information, and closer to the propagade as it is filtered and serve interests foremost

If there were not good journalists I have nothing knew about this movement ... I am shocked to know that you are also organized

Mediapart for years that I tanned them with this: undeclared work (with the complicity of Mediapart also therefore) children to the cinema, that is "justice"?

Who is responsible for this obscurantism is not my main focus, but my main concern (my daughter hostage): my aim is to rip obscurantism around money creation so that all sort winner of the "power "usurers that leads to ruin, including our environment
I'm not talking about Freemasonry, but it actually party like banks, countries, etc.
yes it is as systemic problem. With behemoths overthrow
the guy who speaks usurer while rates have never been lower ...
but it is the pitch that freaks me Cyril ð It looks to me like a crazy hair
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit the Qur'an strongly condemns usury, and even announced a war Would you talk about these suras, or Islamic finance?
rates ? usurer? @ondortlejouronboitlanuit
ouch ð
Usurers this ruse, it wears users!
@cyrildelacour: Islamic finance, you speak of the guys who pay with their Amex Centurion at 20%?
1% interest, this ruse, this ruse,

2% interest, use it, use it,
2% interest, it wears users!
3% interest, this ruse, this ruse,

4% interest, use it, use it,

Should perhaps remove them the privilege of money creation, right?
I've never seen an Amex Centurion, is what color?

@stocky: This is an Amex Centurion. It is provided by invitation only, after an initial payment of 5000 USD and annual fees of 2500USD
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: I do not know, I know the suras that condemn usury as follows (I am a Christian): 275. Those who eat [practice] of usury will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of the touch of Satan upset. This is because they say: "Trade is just like usury," but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. He, therefore, ceases as soon as it came an admonition from his Lord, may retain what he has previously acquired; his case is for Allah. But whoever returns ... so these are the people of the Fire! They will abide therein.
276. Allah will deprive usury and made almsgiving fruitful. And Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner.
278. O you who believe! Fear Allah; and give up what remains of usury, if you are believers.
279. And if you do not, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger. And if you repent, you shall have your capital. You léserez person, and you will not be wronged.
Personally I know that theory does not always mean practice

It'll save you think of the Judeo-maçonno-China-reptilian conspiracy
@satanicwarmaster: hard to deny that the interests related to wear form the mobile to numerous plots
should think about making an Islamic bank in France yours XDDDD
@satanicwarmaster: so much express denial (and contempt), is not it?
@stocky: Citizens Bank or managed by the French
@cyrildelacour: what's the difference?
@stocky: managed by the French
@cyrildelacour: one can imagine an Islamic bank managed by the french, finally there is the word that changes
are already cooperative banks, what is the difference with a citizens bank?
@stocky: bank managed by the French who use the money "frank wear" is an idea
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: it strikes the currency "national"
@cyrildelacour the ECB so?
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: the ECB is especially independent voters, not a dependent citizen bank which uses the currency, not so difficult to understand, right?

Good evening, some information on recent movements 2010/2011, the Occupy movement to try to take in Paris.
But it was under Sarkozy, police pressure to Bastille and the gagging of the mainstream media that it did not take. http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/06/21/pourquoi-le-mouvement-des-indignes-reste-limite-en-france_1538605_823448.html in particular paragraph A police pressure complicating rallies
Because remember, France was indignant against the pension reform in October / November 2010 (3 million people in the street, blocking the start of raffineries)http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/10/29/retraites-62-ans-trois-millions-de-manifestants-26-de-popularite-pour-sarkozy_1433060_823448.html)
For the record, http://paris.reelledemocratie.net/node/135 CR General Assembly May 31, 2011 These committees meet at 16:30 Thursday, June 2, 2011, on the Boulevard Richard Lenoir. Displaced to make them invisible, framed by CRS as impossible to do before the Bastille steps. A permanent presence of CRS, 1 every 5 m for 2 months before the steps of the Bastille !! perhaps it has forgotten what France under Sarkozy (Hortefeux, Gueant Woerth Lagarde ...).

I am not therefore Lille and I'm still trying to understand the concept of night standing
ondortle c what?
Peace Love Unity Respect
Ysi1, there is nothing to Lille?
peace and love good c
In any case in Lille they chat channel has larigot ð
Oh yeah, and they talk about?
they are like us, I guess ...
it is hidden or moderator, c that tonight?
bah commissions and organization but each chan!

The cat? The 'Mr Amaury is where it seems ...
Compared to what?
hello Mr. Amaury
report what what?
"You find that c better organized?"
yes, chat
Yes, after I come not long ^^
I spend my time on the place and I try to understand, again, what is your overall feeling
But in any case it is very practical to discuss when you're not there.
I'm past the place just now, there was no Ace of Spades, suddenly I turned around
I believe that taking the time to listen to everyone's good
BL, I agree with you
Ace of spades?
(Same question for me ondort)
The feeling of movement that's chris?
Motörhead or Armand de Brignac is the choice
One is little more than another place not ^^
ah, I understand better .... you could offer a music commission
chosen the right ^^
This is not really a subject to "choice" music, more culture as a theme, and this is certainly already created.
Bl I believe that access to music at all, training and listening without it costing an arm, well c
Culture in general also true c
lenny mtorhead, it's not the guy who collected Nazi memorabilia d?
This is not something rather acquired through internet?
The music that is expensive to produce still
c music such as books and the rest, if you can not read or do, how to judge?
Yes, but there are alternatives to the big labels etc ... I guess, I know much, but if you love music you can make the first live, craftsmen, and this is no less although a professional thing.
live music of all, it is not always cheaper
4 decks between David Guetta and synthesizer Jean-Michel Jarre, I do not know what's more expensive to live
ondortlejour you already do music?
Yes
yes, but if you encounter great singers, composers, players c really better to understand
I mean you can find places you produce or not in exchange for a jackpot, but fun to play!
well it's easy to pick up a pretty nice vst for free right?

Yes there may be the opinion of one who also listens without knowing there alongside scenes.
@ Nemolivier.paris: at the same time must be stupid to think that there are only villains and nice
@ Nemolivier.paris: altogether. Besides, his tweet can not apply to him anyway because he solved more problems than it created.
I would not be at his place ....
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: er if we can do live in these conditions.
I'm on here is a guy who voted on 2 Holland in 2012
and the misspelling is ð gift
see more
in front of Holland, there was a Hungarian prince married to an Italian princess, it was not hard to choose
I still do not understand how one can be disappointed in Holland. Everything was in his interview to the FT.
I too feel the shot the same people who will vote against lepen the 2nd round for 2017 and will be happy
Hopefully there will be enough votes for or alternative!
you'll see
do not vote for I think lestylo
I not understand how you do to stay calm even while the state does not take into account your meme votes réfédundom
there will be no science fiction.
ah yes, that clearly, I revel in advance all disappointed Hollandisme who will go to vote in the second round Juppé
always stay calm and think
I think in Switzerland if the state does not prennait a vote into account he would overthrow xD
lol
Swiss would do what?
even mass immigration they are obliged to respect the
Juppé Thomson sold for 1 euro to Korean, c super intelligent
Yes but it is not used to it, not many people would the mouth for something he does not know
@Cmoi They jicleraient people in power, would replace them I guess
Swiss ?
in Switzerland, they are all from Swiss cows make milk and cuckoos exist
lol
@stocky: I think the state is more or less enthusiasm to sit on voting against mass immigration
Swiss it benefit both the "situation" but shhh eh! ð we love them we will b **** well
c true, they do not mix, so you can listen to 5 and change daily
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: ca is actually creating tension
It still lacks the famous survey wave ...
Swiss Monaco Luxembourg Andorra etc.
survey wave? xD
you do not just prevent immigration
@stocky: so much tension that the vote on the expulsion of foreign criminals has been rejected ...
Well the earthquake that gets things done.
I'm sure the "lambda" Switzerland has more influence on the French policy as "lambda" french
@ Ben.rien.Aix: the wave rises, it dates from 2007 this theory
what you can do, c empower them to go to school and succeed
 
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: yes, there is a problem handling .. ð
beneficial knowledge circle we will say
@stocky: populism, it is the problem of direct democracy
 
Well I was referring to the discussion in the same place yesterday around 17 / 18h it seems to me ^^
do not return the foreign criminals should be kept here in prison
insurers coughed bankers
long time
xDDDDD
there is more room in French prisons
it is against the human rights to add more people there
necessarily, it puts guy for smoking a joint or sold weed in small quantities
Ondo, c true
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: the most funny is that the government closed non prisons?
It is not even basic super smart to pile up, ditto for hospitals, dilute the problems that are solved more or less ...
allowed their assets they live in without piss people ... the banks have little to be ca 10% of assets in paris should be enough
You know a lot of weed smoker in jail, you ???
@stocky: they closed I think the most unhealthy
yes but not sellers
everyday
and what to sell 3 strips ca deserves prison?
In nothing
I worked in health (which was a prison). It was not smoking.
endangering the lives of others
people should not look you a tote accused the banks is a problem yes but it's not just because of the Swiss or countries that have money
we're not in jail for selling 3 bars today in France, it takes a lot more than that, especially recidivism. Stop eh fantasies.
No he just play the game of the room and it works well for them Swiss
yeah we're going to jail when you get aggresser boxed for example ...
should not defend himself in France eh
This time the prison, I tend to believe those who have "lived" the thing more or less, because trust what is said like that, the "one says" ... This is not necessarily exact.
ben will ask then
in my opinion your current problems is ca historic date of crap that there was during the French Revolution
and banks, prisons etc are only effects
hmm this is not entirely wrong in so far as many of the current state process are from the revolution
the problem does not come from the revolution, at least I think not
life in France, the political game was not as rotten in the 70 or 80
oh well, you think?
Yes
I'm not so on ...
Hi, sorry su off topic, you would know how to reach the not manifest commission, it seems to me that there is a facebook group for those who lives not in Paris but I did not find the
The real problem is human stupidity.
ha ben with that, we will go far

What interest?
be it a player or elbows jacky the PMU, which puts full excavation with the money I care little lobby
the draw is an idea
the result will be the same ...
@Cmoi: As a computer, there is nothing worse than relying on artificial intelligence.
everything depends on parameters not?
Which was tested there a long time successfully in ancient Greece it seems not?
@Cmoi: No.
cad? it's too over as the answer
 
@ Ben.rien.Aix: Yes but it will not pass in the head because of the people-the Greeks had slaves. they had the steam engine but they did not care because-they had slaves
What interest?
be it a player or elbows jacky the PMU, which puts full excavation with the money I care little lobby
JACKY PRESIDENT! ð
yes ancient greece had the steam engine JAmes watt fuck you

you can explain the data analysis can be a child? I dunno
he is right
@Cmoi: Ca your thing looks a bit like Skynet in Terminator ...

ca policy should be by all comprehenssible
good in any case it is futuristic but it's not too out of it to be "good" while Greece it had market.
Rousseau was favorable in the draw.
@Cmoi: The data analysis is not neutral, ever.
Otherwise, there are no worries about putting video links here?
a computer is UNABLE to get the go ð
Oh and if you calculate the worker dying on average a year XX XX the framework etc.
I trol alala
you create an example pension calculation on sales
@ DRnaud.Lille: not no worries
@stocky: (re) we are human, political animals (the time we live in "society" Politicians are they doing in the jargon, this is because their policy is not to be understood..
force workers dying on average younger they should have higher wages
@Cmoi: And after you decide what?
 
ca pointless to calculate pensions if one has an unconditional basic income
@ Mortarshell.techinfo.cergy: thank you!

the world is crazy, stay up stand up for your rights
well if it's just a figure of history actually
@Cmoi: The machine is faster than the human is not possible
@Cmoi It will appeal the Constitutional Council are corrupt
gonna do shit
like robot that calculates the stock market and that are crap and which have seizures
me the story of power is just a trick of animals for ca ... humans are not good the top saw their origins. Let the algos work in our place
@stocky: good example.
@Sent: Book the politician volunteers to function?
Good evening!
@Cmoi: The algos they create by whom?
not stocky, robots who calculated the course of the scholarships are not shit
ah sisi
not often we will say ...
an algo a goal and did it already becomes political.
An assembly of people who are drawn, compensation, regularly renewed with one vote each. How fair and impartial?
you publish a crappy stuff on twitter and your robot it is Chutter your country @Cmoi
why optimize such thing rather than another.
how to choose the priority?
do you want to make a record of the proceedings in a pad?
the computer must constantly take decision to have a solution that fits properly around his case
@ Ben.rien.Aix: how fair and impartial? I would say that it depends on the decision, in an emergency or not, etc.
Yes stocky normal well you publish a crappy stuff on twitter your course will go down anyway
@Cmoi: Then imagine a policy with robots that analyze people, they just people trollent
well you create an open source with a comprehensible and understandable algo params
@Cmoi: And your robot is crap
then indeed artificial intelligence is fun, it helps to globalize, but there's always a purpose and that is toujour mess.
troll how?
For the priorities they must then refocus on local democracy. Such territory has it as a priority, another that.
fake datas?
kind pretend to do burn out? to die?

the revenue base is like the RSA?
@Cmoi: Precisely for this that you can use the decision aid, but the algorithm will not decide in your place that is best for you.
@ Juju29 why radio up?
always it indicated a goal
this is not an income given to all without @Cmoi condition to have enough to live on and live with dignity
the goal is the wellness
but no one has little to be the "sensor well be!"
at the base is standing for radio chat
@Cmoi: We mostly not the same!
@Cmoi: With a fuzzy concept like this, it will be fun.
yeah well that's not what nimporte? Custom I stopped to work if I have an unconditional income
I admit it's good but it's not sustainable
@Cmoi: Oh no.
@ Juju29: I put it or then? Below?
@Cmoi: A "sensor well be" I would say money, otherwise we are "sensitive" (more or less)
Perhaps it is necessary to create another
@Cmoi: Everyone says AC and in fact there have been surveys and the majority of people would continue to work because-you mad when you anything you need to do something,
I confess to the algorithm is not the time, but again in a few dozen years
but I think a mind map could be more interesting

I can slacker of entire years

I can give you lessons if you want ð
@ Juju29: we gossiped on another chan about this?
@Cmoi But as you are a minority you pose no problem to the system of basic income
@stocky: besides there are plenty of people who bump currently in republic.

Is it possible to create a channel currency / basic income / finance for example?
this would be an opportunity to get involved in citizen initiatives, take the time to learn an artistic practice simple examples ...
@ Ben.rien.Aix: perhaps there is already enough channels right?
@Cmoi: Money has the value that we give him is that piece of paper or vacuum often.
@Cmoi: Tax, tax, robots do not need money to work
yeah it's a utopian thing what
It is used to exchange wholesale.
@Cmoi: Ca are suede, ireland, saudi saoudie ...
but is used for another purpose, dominate.
I see here that "Home" and "communication", there is another channel list?
@Cmoi: Ca existed in libya
in libya they petroleum has goog
we we have a énarques nourish
 
@Cmoi: Suede it what? ð in Germany as there are tests
in Sweden *
ireland tax refund throughout europe the cash flows afloat
AC germany astonish me the universal income
suede is also not the oil?
@Cmoi: Yet there are tests
the problem with this basic income history / salary for life and all that, is that it is far, far too far. I do not say unthinkable, but it is more a horizon line than anything else. There are things to work much closer to us.
in short, we must stop thinking that the relationship between money and work is direct.

it can be cool
yeah unconditional income is very difficult or impossible
like that the proposals and what emerges could be said to the AG or the other republic
impossible in the state can be, but it deserves to be considered, saying that it will not be useless
and even if it seems unlikely, I prefer people who think about it, rather than people who comment not touch my post
people they march the room, they want more than the neighbor
it's too easy to say "impossible"
@Cmoi It's wrong I'm not like that
ben you're not representative of the population while

@stocky: I love the operation of AG who stand up for the Republic: Democratic praxis
@cyrildelacour: If you want to hope that continues DEMOCRACY does not rely on IT
In any event, even a citizen vote parfais without popular education and independence of the media, ca return to the same. It will make you vote for the same vaseline today
@cyrildelacour: IT is controlled by humans, and if one day we made machine that can think for them same, it will still be limited or exterminate it
@stocky: yes, I rather on account of citizens for democracy (local in his exercise then the federation of local democracies)
hence the relevance of open source chat rooms, free expression, the list is long

about Depeche to press ..... "maximum of n and male citizens" .... it will not, I'm not citizens and do not recognize any legitimacy to the institutions that ensues ... can put "maximum earthling and earth" .... it changes many things for many of us this notion
"A more participatory democracy" ..... A democracy any court, "participatory implies that we amount already in democracy ..... it is a big problem of substance by form
And what is this frenzy of "Citizen standing. In order to make the proper judgment, pursuant to Article XII of the
Declaration of Rights of Man and of the Citizen
. "
we redo the same as Babylon, is that the program ..... It is certainly a joke in bad taste this "flyer"
https://wiki.nuitdebout.fr/images/b/b0/Communique_accueil_Nuit_Debout_imprimable.pdf
@ Alex-rac: For notes on Citoyen.ne.s democracy and I share the same opinion as you. In drafting the statement we made the choice to take the words in their ordinary meaning (sense Newspeak if you prefer) and discreet irony underline their true meaning: a citizen makes policy. A democracy that is not truly participatory is not one.
This choice was made because the purpose of the statement is not to bring the claims to change the political system but to report on Night Stand to the attention of the general public through the media, so we need to talk about their code .
Otherwise the reference to Article 12 it is the comic spring (two defining judge: opinion and judicial) and is used to refer to police violence (that make us laugh yellow).
Of course these choices are open to criticism and that's why I thank you for your return. If you want to propose an improvement of the release you are free to do so. ð

Hi Here the event for a # 1erMaiDebout throughout France and for all cities which are Republic Square in Paris https://www.facebook.com/events/540805579424550 to share! We are waiting with banners and placards to each of your cities!
@cyrildelacour: yes, a reaction, the only truth of this conspi video is that the DNS belongs to the company Raiz, a member who is part of the movement. The domain name will be transferred to something else, association, organization, it is difficult to choose, ustement for trust issues, transparency, but we already have with us companies that are blameless in this Point (squaring the net, open democracy now), but the transfer is not done in one day, because you have to evaluate everything. The NDD was filed in emergency for the movement, to be sure coke and other enlarge your penis take, or a guy to sell T shirt. Then the "conspiracy" side "fascho" the thing is completely stupid. you can see here in ls dev channel, digital etc ... that all decisions are taken among 300 people, in front of 1500 people, for digital, there is no particular authority setting from the difficulty of ensuring that everyone can learn from the advanced digital projects, and can vote and participate, but the process and the will are there. So video = conspi, moron, political division, hoax

The presence of Alain Finkielkraut at Night Stand, a simple hazing of the French Academy
What the hell was so Alain Finkielkraut Saturday night on the Republic Square? Today we know a little more about the reasons that led the academician make a visit to movement Night Stand. Several sources confirm that its passage was in fact the last stage of hazing to consolidate its integration into the French Academy.

Good evening to you all I want to know if the movement will continue until July?
Good question Socrafte.Singapour @! We hope it will continue, but unlikely in this form (we already slashed all ^^)
In my view, we can not be sure, links between the participants in Night Stand have been created already, they will surely continue, however, the movement in its current form, as said pierrelalu, may not continue (in this form )
ð 1
Why "in this form"?
Socrates: all night, it's a little hard for the organizers ....
n Still, I am hopeful that the movement continues! especially with the sunny days arrive! (By cons, I have more doubts about its survival this winter ?)
ð 2
@ Sam.hacker.paris: ok! do you mean by "I do it again?"
IMHO it lasts for, it'd be interesting to go down the proposals that begin to emerge wiki ð
So ultimately there would need more members if I understand?
For me it is the solution Socrafte ð
By increasing the number of people, it enhances the "rotating capabilities" so it allows people to this rest and motivate each other ð
Socrafte.Singapour @: we get to 90 000 signatories of the petition but impossible to contact them eg

@nathaniel I find a shame not to make the commission meeting April 20 ð
Nathaniel: Committee for Drugs and freedom, I invite you to reflect on the fact that a drug user, including hard drugs, he made a conscious choice about the use of his body, hidden by the fact against that the health system is shared, and therefore it imposes on other choices. This is even more true for cigarettes and alcohol.

Sam.hacker.paris @: Yes, adding the event ok thank you. But then relay the agenda "official" ...?
@nathaniel: Committee for Drugs and freedom, I invite you to reflect on the fact that a drug user, including hard drugs, he made a conscious choice about the use of his body against the occult that the health system is shared, and therefore it imposes on other choices. This is even more true for cigarettes and alcohol.
Come and discuss with us. Indeed the issue of public health, its cost and virtuous practices, this is the kind of topic that can be debated. ð
@ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille: By "conscious choice" you also hear that what led him to drug use is a choice on his part?
@ Vecu.Psychologie.Paris: I answer their first report: https://wiki.nuitdebout.fr/wiki/Villes/Paris/Drogues_et_libert%C3%A9/CR/16_avril
wiki.nuitdebout.fr
Cities / Paris / Drugs and freedom / CR / 16 April NuitDebout
which reads in part: Motion 1: 'The Committee considers the use of psychotropic drugs as a right to dispose of his body, of his conscience and of his privacy. "
Motion 2: "The commission denied the prohibition of access to the plant and its free use. N No plant is illegal. "
Motion 3: "The Commission considers the right to access a non-ideological information and prevention anxious to education and public health. "
Motion 4: "The Commission denies that a user can be pursued by the police and justice. A user is not a criminal. "
Motion 5: "The Commission proposes to continue the reflection on the legal availability of modes drug case by case, in the worries of coach without encouraging or stigmatize. "

@ Vecu.Psychologie.Paris: unfortunately I'm not Parisien and can come and talk ð
Ok, I note your point to the next agenda if you book me a clear title. ð
@nathaniel: You have a cat here?
@nathaniel: and suddenly, you can convey an idea: if drug users make a conscious choice, then they declare to the health pooling system, and must contribute more to rebalance things. That must in my view be part of the conscious choice made, plus it is educational about the dangers of drug use. Can be extended to other hazardous substances such as alcohol or cigarettes elsewhere.
Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille @: ah yes good idea and we do that also for big!
(What it takes sometimes to hear)
@ Sam.hacker.paris not only I did not say, but I did not even think.
@ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille: but why? overweight people because of their food choices are costly to the health pooling system, so I do not understand why you patronized some and not others
Ok I note. But to answer you: in a legal system there are taxes that are used to it, simply. Then when you take The US case states that have legalized weed, the collected money windfall tax takes more than well the health, and can even be made available for education or other public service. ð

Kurzgesagt In a Nutshell
Why The War on Drugs Is a Huge Failure
@nathaniel: yes, it can be done like that too, but the tax system also allows a parallel system of black market (I have not said I was against, I said that we must take in account ^^) Moreover, the cost of smoking to society is not offset by what it pays in taxes, so you must also think of balancing

www.lemonde.fr
The UN document the failure of the war against drugs
The special session of the United Nations General Assembly would focus prevention and care.
@ Sam.hacker.paris: eating remains a vital need. We do not choose to eat but what you eat. By against drugs, we choose well (according to the commission) to consumption. This is where I put the distingo. Free for you to disagree, but thank you not to go too fast and taxing me like children.
Come on, it's nice but it's not the place to debate, good day to you. ð
ð 1
@nathaniel: good evening and good commission ^^
@ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille: eating 8000 calories a day is not a vital need!
@ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille: you also chosen to eat healthy or shit, this has a cost (the most important of all there ...), thus taxing the food that makes you sick, so it seems a good idea. ð
ð 1
(For the food that sickens)
Do you really think that the `channel accueil`soit the place to debate?
But how to explain that drugs that do not make you sick are prohibited and those that cause illness are "encouraged", at least very very present (industry, advertising, lobbies)
Sorry @ Julien_Ente.Lille We talk Saturday! ð
As the Committee has no assigned chanel, I took home to share my ideas. Indeed, this is not the place, that's why I started a private conversation with Sam ^^
@nathaniel: @ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille and let's create that channel and share the wiki page on the Committee ð I invite Nathaniel to do so since it is part of the commission

Within weeks, the most important social movement consisting of the last 10 years in France, s is literally emptied of its substance subversive to take the form of a friendly alternative village and ultra-connected. At a time when neoliberal purge n has never been violent, it is urgent to reset the political struggle rather than creating a new Christiania.
Creating change through strikes and demonstrations? I think that create / think a more likely alternative system to emerge that if asked, through popular pressure, a change is as strange about

why fakir monopolizes the project #nuitdebout and discredit the work of the AG?
@all why fakir monopolizes the project #nuitdebout and discredit the work of the AG?
they do not discredit, the meeting at the labor exchange is symptomatic of a ruffin side is fighting to stay in the concrete and make things "hard", while the other half of the speakers are there to come and preach to their parish as if it were the free speaking at the GA
they are two different visions that attempt to discuss but it does not work
no, he monopolizes the projection of #nuitdebout in 2min AG would have been as tt the world
yes, but this is not an AG
Yes, and why he ferauit the agenda of the GA?
this is not an AG, I repeat, it is an evening debate which is proposed here
"He would make the agenda of AG" xD
He could not say that, if @LoGduPerigord?
yes I also repeat myself how is it that an external commission meeting to make proposals to the agenda of the GA?
they are proposals, the discussion evening will bring its proposals and work with the AG as any commission
and it will be voted
HD 1
fakir is huge in its own committees and discuss with unions
therefore recognizes the sovereignty of the AG
where I could possibly join the questioning @LoGduPerigord is the perception - again - when the mass media will transcribe. They are likely, as usual, to ignore that it is of "proposals"
yes while baffouant the right to speak in the meeting and imposing its schedule to submit the next?
ok, well, we understood that you did not like the fakir, I personally think nothing of them, but in this case they behave correctly in the Democratic field
you think what you want, I consider it a privilege
@LoGduPerigord: If you have written references the above I take out a small package of bonds to be processed by the communication team
I have not said that I did not like fakir, I see a private press which gives it the right to propose agendas and meetings parallel to AG
yes good will, if you will, is a dirty fascist ruffin go.
  1
it deprives others of speech
it assumes rights
no,
if it freezes it s'trouve babies as the bastard
question: Does he said fakir speaks in his own name or in the name of fakir?
I'm not saying this is a fascist, I say fakir takes the decision to propose an agenda for all ag and discussions with unions
there's a time must come back to earth
Yes, the Earth is the AG

but the fact is they were there
BYou two interpelations at Lille following a CRS raid on trade union premises, in reaction, this following direct action of an individual "third party" that launched a brick through a window ...

who better than Lordon, piketti and appalled economists to talk about the economy, who better than ruffin or Plenel to talk about history of protest movements and so on in other areas. the Republic of ag that's nice, but the opposite camp is not in lyric poetry then will have to talk seriously on a day when the other

so he tried to balk and saloper the hotline, but there it ended up falling on the bones of small admin good.
a representative of ag remarked that ag have a project to suggest the contrary of what to ruffin said in his speech and the meeting of May 7 and 8, that ruffin is eager to take the floor to say must progress on the project proposed fakir, poof, gone the work of ag

I do not think it's fake noon
about @kraft it must be always on his bike to try to arrive on time.

the problem here is obvious, fakir impose his agenda his word facing the AG, it could be fakir or any other media group, but it is the press so that his ideas prpose AG.

we must also recognize the activist work and stop talking about Recycling

@ Mortarshell.techinfo.cergy: tou mé you plé
I note that a newspaper group acts as a think tank, made his Lobbie, its prpores discussions with the trade unions for its project, deal with representing ag ag reminding that have their project and have not wait to be told what to do.
and in terms of implementation and effectiveness of the movement, I would have to give voice to M6 even if the subject is not distorted and if it makes a profit Night Stand
it seems that people do not want intellectuals (though ESSENTIAL to creating a climate for minimum pre-revolutionary, read brothel history of books) or "professionals" of the struggle (and I'm not talking unions)

To which New World takes us Night Stand?
To continue to occupy the land and consolidate its legitimacy privileged place of public debate, the movement began to develop a "cultural" program with film screenings and concerts.
"Bolster its legitimacy"
hell, they will eventually make us think that the people have perhaps more the right to consider as people ð
I find his relevant analysis.
At least it has the merit of explaining why ND takes so well to a certain part of the population and not for another.
I can not see someone with critical spirit refuse ND. Unless caught by capitalism perhaps.
(Or fainéantisme, defeatism, jenfoutisme)
@ Espion.Tournai: I think the sentence should understand "assert its position as a leader" (if I translate in corporate Newspeak) and not to implicate it should not exist.

"But perhaps most importantly its ability to exceed this opening between itself François Ruffin question posed itself, resulting in absences for less glaring in the concerns of the movement, as the issue of migrants, that of suburban youth as the most popular categories, particularly of those who have been tempted by the protest embodied by the FN vote. "
Uh, but it's wrong, these matters precisely due to each AG and each session of free speech.
@diego: even in that sense, I'm struggling. ND is not leading, ND is the expression of the people (or at least partially). What ND wants is "the people" who wants it, right ??
(And those who do not agree are part ^^)
@ Espion.Tournai: The author takes the look of a sociologist and in his article in no time denigrates ND, he just tries to study - relatively neutral - the social dynamics that drive the movement. And his reasoning is worth being followed I think.
Personally I understood: ND has similarities May 68 May 68 but where was the union of youth and workers, ND seems to be the union of youth and an expanded middle class ( middle class since its creation became politicized [the sense of the term] finally).
But given your reactions I had to misunderstand. ð
a neutral look that is?
The question is to know at what point we consider that the integrated movement of the working classes.
@ Espion.Tournai: ND is not the people, ND is the portion of the people who believes in ND project. ND is not my family, not my friends, it's not ....
(I mean my family and friends are against ND)
The BanlieueDebout movement, the presence of ND workers in cities is rather a good sign. The difficulty is whether there is a popular support behind, it's not easy to be determined.
@diego: in general, it's the same for me too .. but I think that people either do not seek to understand / get involved or are easy excuses ..
 
@ I'm gonna bibis the m 'bed
 
Frankly, when I see social struggles throughout history, and the importance they have for the future ..
It all began 3000 years ago when the Egyptian workers decided to refuse to work because they are not remunerated ..
A famine, hundreds of deaths, months without work .. And the beginning of social rights ??
@inkey: Besides, is what you have information on Standing Suburbs? The media try to make it look like white bobos meetings and conclude the operation to fail on the grounds that the suburbs consist mainly of racialized individuals. What does return to the reality?
@ Espion.Tournai: you can also try to understand but do not find their account, or find the relevant movement

@ Espion.Tournai: There is a difference between "is against ND priori" and "would be to ND provided you have enough information," I agree. But it does not change that at present the majority of the population is not found in ND ((primarily because it rejects a priori ND)) ND therefore can not claim to represent the people - for now.

Robert mmm go / Larousse / Wikipedia - I describe to me the people and it makes me no harm.
I describe myself as a non-tooth I'm like social caste in India I would be a Chandala
in my opinion if you describe yourself as a non-tooth, somewhere you stigma acts by F. Holland.
I can not justify ð
not only is that I am physically, teeth damaged by financial inability to take care of my health properly.
(The issue of caste Hindu is not foreign to Night Stand. Some run it)

castes exist in France when your parents are too poor to go to college, they already bled to pay you your school books, then college? go work...

Otherwise, I thought to bed after reading an article, but I had to react.
An article which claims that Fakir Night Stand refuses any organization.
I disagree with this statement.
To my mind ND has an organization.
ND refuses vertical orga but is organized - and promotes a horizontal orga.

@diego PIN communication. we check tomorrow
indeed, I trust you on analysis
go in an hour we begin to discuss what does the term "society"
you know people can be compared to him plebs who is derogatory and is used by Roman aristorate.
@LoGduPerigord: I apologize BUT I absolutely can not let you compare some déterminimes acting now in France with "caste"
It's hard to follow you ð
ben Yet there it's lived, I talk to you years of agricultural slaves 50-80 French.
the concept of "caste" referring to the Hindu model, for which a majority of French did not even necessary balls to try to decipher the democratic development
@ Lilliott.multitasking.irl: What does that mean PIN?
I talk to you workers, I can tell you about the worker son
the legacy of caste.
the experience certainly, but then under "slave-masked" - not "caste"
c CCA great, you just need a term that is not caste
that Hugo already termed as social reproduction cf miserable.
 
(Because caste is based on assumptions that are shared even by discriminated castes .... so it sucks!)
Yes
Pin = pin @diego
I agree therefore also
you know I have neighbors who are not read to them.

I suspect
especially
(For your neighbors find no trick "play is not for me")
"Social education"

when you inherit the social position of your parents what to call it?
_aime good historical calculations @ mortarshell.techinfo.cergy
I would say social determinism or socio-professional @LoGduPerigord?
when it adds the social weight and behavior we have with you?
@LoGduPerigord: Whether you're a student and you deserve you worked hard for your future. Unlike those big wankers who have become unemployed and have what they deserve!
 
and your idea of ??Les Miserables, yes it great but then we will talk about "archetypes" (fantine - valjean - Marius - duvet)
 
it's funny, I was talking with my man just now to the idea of ??removing the legacy to improve equity and reduce disparities rich / lean x)
yes, inheritance is a result of not changing.

@ LoG your question, I'm not sure but yes I think "social determinism" or "individual" covers well the whole problem
yes caste and better.

It's a beautiful day starts here but if that 6:30

@LoGduPerigord: The notion of caste and social determinism, I invite you to brainstorm with the guys charter-drafting

Good evening. Someone has the link framapad radiodebout yesterday please?
Hi, I have the impression that the movement is weakened?
I disconnected republic, I had got used to watch direct, but then nothing
the program does not indicate for Friday
news?
@ Lilliott.multitasking.irl: I found it disconcerting not to attend the conference today at the Bourse du Travail knowing that Anne-Lise Debout of the Gazette had kept a place for me beside her for that so we can have a transcript and a video backup the entire conference Periscope. And take the opportunity to take some pictures for the Gazette as well. I found it - TF1 be relevant now. Knowing that he would have transcribed a small part of what was said. Also as I said in the previous message each time Periscope little has nearly 300 subscribers around we are 5 to be rather permanently in place for 3 weeks. Place 5 x 300 it would have added 1,500 people to the conference when there was already no room in it would have been pretty well do not you think? I can not blame anyone obviously security question can not put more than one person can hold in a room. There is only one hour Periscope who managed to get in and could not filmed everything that's why it's interesting when we are many that avoids the technical problems that prevented transcribe all of what we filmed. That said I do not know if we can find the video on Dailymotion I saw that there was a link to a live transcript ... if only we had more to have it before sending any fees Périscope viewer on this link. Maybe we should mind for the next time if there are other conferences whether here or elsewhere in France where in the world can be in French or English maybe we should think about redo transcribed live on the site with a video projector would allow the greatest number to enjoy it and hesitate disappointment of hundreds and hundreds of people who could not go to the conference today at the Labour Exchange.

Other than that the concert of the Standing Louis Orchestra was magnificent tonight I hope that they will very quickly it was a success on the incredible site and on social networks too!

But now, suppress taxes, what a brilliant idea. ð
In the ten commandments I find no reference to the protection of the environment, or for solidarity with the disabled. To believe that they had a reflectivity slightly less successful today there are a few thousand years.
Finally, it depends for whom.
Peace and love on Terre.Elle is too good and can give us the energy (through wind and warmth "Geothermal") without polluting .The oil, we can get passer.ça that would avoid the guerres.Rappel Syria lot of oil and this is how all these good people are at the rue.C'est a scandal!

@ Pokilo.Berlin: if you're right.
Hello everyone
@ Tribut.isabelle: No it's not every family to take care of its old, and children, and the disabled. A disabled without family, you let him die in his corner? Solidarity and pooling against the risk are only effective at large scale. It is the society that has to do it. So no, it's not easy to organize. So no, the simplification is not a solution.
ð 1 ð ð 1 1
Prefer reformulation rather than begin a sentence no. After reading previous posts I think cybergrunge, tribut.isabelle and I are totally in phase.
And if we use citizen instead of people used to disguise the poor in Mahogany salons.
ð 2
Are people here who were at the Labour Exchange last night?
"No" ð I do not think we are in phase. It is important to emphasize the disagreements, and mine is deep with about tribut.isabelle
@ Billy-Pierre-Yves: we could not get too crowded. If you find a video that interests me.
Same, a video or a simple report
The videos are on dailymotion fakir I think.

I personally found the interventions of Lordon and Ruffin but not much more. It takes 15 minutes.
"Last night in the dung of work, the commission" convergence of struggles "Night Stand (Paris and others) supported by the newspaper Fakir (So François Ruffin) organized a discussion evening" Night Stand and after "?
The choice of each word in my sentence is important.
The struggles Convergence Committee can not lay claim representative standing nights. There are many other emotions standing in the nights that are not found in these discourses. Neither Fakir nor Ruffin. Think of it as a group of common will that formed through, or within, "Night Stand". Night stand has allowed these people to recognize and begin to move in the same direction. But the nights standing enable many more people to recognize themselves around topics and others to move in other directions.
This preamble past I invite you to listen Lordon who (in my opinion) well represents the will of political affirmation, constitution movement, active citizenship and marked orientation.
Much of what he says can be cleaving.

We regularly and continuous debate in Nice. And I think it should be defined as Night Stand is NOTHING but allows ALL. It is a place of encounter and exchange which in itself may appear as the "soft citizenism, not giving birth in either useless" but actually allows the emergence of hard citizenism movements such as the commission convergence of struggles which to here. Set night standing by the action or the will of some of its committees would be simplistic.
Ruffin and also because it is funny.

And I'll wait for the full report of this discussion evening because it's generally the direction I would like to take personally. The direction of the hard citizenism. not necessarily that of Lordon. "

will. Geez ...
@ Billy-Pierre-Yves: I sign: o) or hobbes nor Lenin
@ Billy Pierre Yves If I rephrase, you consider that ND is - nothing less - a reappropriation of movement of political power by the citizens. Is that right?
I think that any definition of Night Stand is doomed to failure empirical.
Well, we will learn from our mistakes ð
This is the normal world that tries to label the thing. But the thing is resistant to all its labels.
By cons, initiatives are born in Night Labelled standing. Convergence Committee struggles Lordon and Ruffin is etiquetable. But this is not (in the sense of strict equality) night standing.
labels, and boxes to better divide the world, to cram as a psychotic collector, no thank you.
The labels, it is sometimes useful to know if you are allergic to any of the components ð
The labels used primarily to identify and provide support for reflection. Night Stand is a label for example.
((Label the sense of a scientist, after may be for literary we have different interpretations of the concept of labels.))
Always it is that it is important to ask the question of what we can be for ND.
labels to think about the world? divide, divide, thinking the world is to accept diversity, to accept that everything changes all the time, that's life. How many labels are outdated after being asked? There 'are the dead which change pluis
If ND is my politicization tool, I will come there with reflection, reference documents and pen paper.
By cons, if ND Repub is for me a base to launch before punch operations in Paris (as manifest in St Lazare), I'm not going back with my trowel and my tulip bulbs.
yes @diego
Label is not necessarily divide. Language is the first of the sets of labels, and he seems to have found some use.
punctuality tool, local and temporary.
I think ND is a nebula. And in the nebulae are born stars. Regardless of any individual or collective will of the cloud or dust.
Truth does not exist, there are only local and temporary truths.
And if one is afraid of the stars. the cloud is dispersed ...
@ Billy-Pierre-Yves: 1000
@LoGduPerigord: Good, we do nothing more then?
And there are other possible interpretations of ND. It is necessary to be a piecemeal interpretation - and thus probably false - for reasoning about objects that are beyond us (and beyond us because ND multi polar, decentralized, organic, high spatio temporal evolution).
After so do not be mistaken, and please do not try to interpret a plot plausible interpretation as the only possible. ((That TF1 is interpreting as a ND breakers flock puisance))
no, that's not what I say, to understand the complexity of the world, it is necessary before accepting.
Accepeter that everything changes all the time.
But rationalize by labeling, not simplify the world
@log, truth exists
if you put a label you frozen.
In any case it depends on the motivation of the labeler is ·
as well as the elementary and universal wisdom
Yes and his look, everything is relative to your eyes.
((I have described here using a nomenclature in the scientific world, and it is in this sense that I think important, and trying to "label" Night Stand.))
If you put a label, you can also start thinking

Wednesday, April 20 at 19:00 Fakir & convergence commission struggles / discussion evening on "The step from" LIVE
The Republic Square is filled, and Night standing swarmed in Province and even abroad. Okay, the first step is met. But should we be content? Fakir and commission convergence of struggles invite to a discussion evening on "The step from" Wednesday, April 20 at 19h at the Labour Exchange in Paris.
commisiopn copnvergencs the struggles did not practically speaking, he was there in decor.
@ Just now; o)
I just watched the intervention of Lordon yesterday. I totally agree with his point. To my mind for action and the short term, ND must go in the direction that develops Lordon (actually he did not invent anything, it serves as spokesman - and reminder - a thought that floats in thought collective). I love the idea of ??restoring the sand.
However, to prepare for the post output of the frame and prevent the short-term actions ND being recovered, it must be done background work in the short term is unnecessary and may seem a kind of debate to debate but that its importance if we are to reach a governance without elites. ((But Lordon supports only the first project because it has long studied for its implementation, while the project of a horizontal governance I doubt there is much thought, and so I understand it does not take position above.))
Lordon key anyway a crucial point, as we have not put a bag the neoliberal system and its grip finaciere the entire society, all other claims will be only the pavers into the pond, and the worst is that even this is below those that cleave us. I'm not saying that we must put aside these various claims, but must stop to take the cabbage is whether one is willing to defend this or that idea, a particular mode of action, we must begin to hit all overall, in every sense, to bring harm to a system which urges us all like lemons and never recede malgres few social or political victories we can win here and the. And if we manage to tap international treaties, and even one little eroded the power of the lobbies of finance and shareholding, then it will both offer on the table all these claims that emerge any Azimute ND. and ask that the debate is inevitable and it must prepare on, but never close doors. This debate is of course, what society do we want for tomorrow? But if one succeeds in not opening the breach, this debate is particularly steriile and cleaving.
ð 1
Either way ND is a collection of divisions, but before we dissociate, we stand in solidarity to fuck this system in the air or at least begin to give critical hits.

In other words, if a fellow ND embarked soon, it is a support which refliechira twice before to move. Is this what we want?

@ DRnaud.Lille: What? The police broke into the premises of the CNT to just a stone history that flew in a window ?? I'm the one that the disproportionate reaction of shock?
you know it's every day that police strike steals breaks and doing illegal things ð
but yes it is shocking, like every day
It is also they who handles the problems of aggression, etc ...

You have very lucky if you never had to turn you to the police for help
@Yannou: I do not usually for me every day and these are revelations.
So you're jaded it scares me that I will discover tomorrow.
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: basically there are two types of people, those for whom the police are protection / support, and those for whom it is a daily oppression
ð 1
I doubt if you ask for a "young commuter" if the cops reassure him or do fliper he tell you that they are there to help
in my case, being super white and privileged, I have too much trouble with the cops and jsuis quite certain that if something goes wrong they would protect me
but for others it is not at all the case, and it's pretty outrageous
ð 1
@diego I am jaded by what I see in the press and that the comrades tell me, but I have not experienced myself, I had this chance
@Yannou: I must be too good next time, because to me these people are doing their work, they are not perfect, they are human
ð ð 1 1
And they vote more than 50% for the FN. Nobody is perfect indeed
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: must yavoir means yes. For some people this is clearly institutionalized oppression
but not all, indeed
It really is you think? Can you tell me more? because yes, there are rotten but of a institutionalized say it is I do not see the link.
It's never easy to get a realistic idea, especially if like me you life in a medium sized city. Also be aware that we communicate much more about the negative sides of their actions on the positive side

Yes, but do not make generalization in my opinion, these neighborhoods are disadvantaged areas, both for the population and for the cops who work there. More difficult the conditions are more error are large and numerous.
ð ð 1 1
bah it is certain that in these neighborhoods, people are really mistreated by police
and it's not fair
in the 16th it did not happen like that ð
it is easy to get used to this kind of problems, saying "conditions are difficult" but I think we must continue to denounce the still
yes, I think so. But I also like that the intuition in these qurtiers there in the most violence and drugs etc ... is bound alose
Yes, we must denounce you're right ð
But do not fall into the Heine of the police force in generalizing.
ð 1
The cops, there are good and less good, as everywhere, against the orders they receive are given by head that up to the goodwill of the hierachy. And when the hierachy covers this kind of behavior, we are entitled to be angry, it would even make a little more than indignation.
These "leaders" are set up by the government, which set him up during democratic elections ... so for us it is clear that we must do more than be indignant
we must also consider the fact that the police lack the means to conduct effective policies, particularly in neighborhoods. At one time, there was a real community police, who knew the residents and young people growing up knowing the officers. It did not avoid clashes, but there was a mutual respect. Today, that community policing has been completely dismantled in the name of efficiency, and we see what happens .....
ð 4
yes, and policies of dismantling proximity fonts are also denouncing
Denounce easy, rebuild together is more complicated.
ð 2
suddenly, the police are also oppressed workers by their hierarchy, the "good" no longer have room to do their job (long investigations, little return in terms of arrest, but of dismantling the networks above), and the bad are brought to the pinnacle because they make the figure (as they simply stop pawns)
yes @ lilliott.multitasking.irl
yes @ nemolivier.paris
@ Philippe151101: we can not be agreements ^^ but to rebuild something solid, you still have to identify what doesnt ð
It really hurt actually, it parrait yet evident that a police closer to the people would be more efficase
Of course.
(Meaning it can not be + chord)
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: I remind you that the police are part of the population ^^

And that is more or like moin in the armed
I think the majority of people of ND are more or less agree with these findings. What is forgotten is that governments are not REALLY elected by the people but by the media that tell us who we should or should not elect. And the media, are held by the same operating throughout the society, far from our small daily preocuapations. When the capital police say, which is a somewhat easy shortcuts, it's still a bit in the vrai.Car the state is the state capital. Although the pilociers as individuals do not condone, in their own way, just as we all do, they participate.

Yes, it reveint as much debate in the democratic debate Operates in our society
@ DRnaud.Lille: quite, because as many people say "he must live" and to live in the present system, it takes money, and therefore a job .... and so people n 'have more choice, either the workers or the police

@ DRnaud.Lille: And even if the media did not do what pre choice, elections are not democratic. Since it is enough to change the voting system to change the elected.
@ Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille: Clearly we are all more less chained in this system, and even those who refuse are chained in their opposition to this system, but I think we begin to understand all that little act together. When will the police in the street with young people and the unemployed, and workers to denounce the same pressure that undergoes all the walking or creve it enough.
@ DRnaud.Lille: as I said several people, including RG and CRS, my wish is that the police come to speak personally to the platform that is available to every citizen by NuitDebout ... .. good they replied me that they have the duty of confidentiality (what I expected) but the intention is there ð

Officials and non-permanent staff are subject to reserve duty. This requirement concerns the mode of expression of opinions and not their content. It more or less severe depending on the context and the place of the agent in the hierarchy. Officials and non-permanent staff are also subject to the discretion and secrecy professionals.

@ Pixocode-dev-Lyon: ok, it's good to know ^^
Thank you, I just see how show all ð smileys
 
@ DRnaud.Lille: 50 we can already agree on a broader project to present to others

Lax.Lemecauchapeau.Lille @ Ah oki. But suddenly it's not the duty of confidentiality that prevents peacekeepers from participating / ND testify outside their service.
Or even during.
To address the bottom melts to agree on the shape of our values ??... and the police can participate in this reflection.
@diego: "The reserve requirement applies during and timeless service."
"Any public official must exercise restraint and measured in the oral and written expression of his personal views."
"This obligation does not concern the content of opinions (freedom of opinion is known to public officials), but their mode of expression."
and even: "This obligation continues to apply to suspended officers of their duties and availability."
ie a vacancy agent is still subject to duty reserve ....
You're right @ low.abstraction.besancon, and it must be done, but do not believe either that good ideas will solve everything, There are plenty of good ideas, and they are not always new. It is also the strength of the power to impose a discution on the public debate. I am not certain that ND or bf very effective on this point. Although there is some talk about the revenue base / Universal / wage life right now. And I think it's related to noise that ND is everywhere.
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: To support your words was the example of standing charter are several versions were written more or less independent and are all on the same line of thought.
basically, they have the right to have opinions, not to express them
@diego: yes thank you, it's exatement this kind of example I was thinking
"This obligation does not concern the content of opinions" .... I did not understand. This sentence is hypocritical?
@diego: basically, they have the right to have opinions, not publicly express
Yes and no, basically it's think what you want, but do not express your opinions in the guise of an authority figure
test and expresses opinions respectfully of your function and others.
they always have the right to express their opinion through the vote
(Lol, ð the vote)
It's a good thing after me the obligation of reserve police
(This thing that in the present state no longer serves the function it should fulfill ^^)
@ Low.abstraction.besancon: to some extent yes, but if an officer can not criticize the mode of operation of its external service because of reserve duty, and that despite its internal alarms nothing changes, then where will the public service? dale in the water ....
Haha, I see that you no longer believe in the vote, personally I do not think it's corronpu it counts the votes correctly, and you have the right to vote for any candidate
After if people are manipulated by the media, by their spouses and others it's the same context

Otherwise, I had read that the police CGT strongly condemned the poster of the CGT-infocomm. And suddenly I did not understand why.
I just find the official press release: http://www.police.cgt.fr/IMG/pdf_18-04-2016_reaction_CGT-Police_suite_a_l_affiche_publiee_par_un_syndicat_CGT-3.pdf
And in fact it's just about them was manipulated ... ._.
"The CGT-Police as all colleagues, who perform their duties lapopulation service was insulted. (...) The same appears with the picture DENOS two ministers rather than the CRS logo would actually target those responsible, instead UNDO their game, digging once more the gap between the population and police.

"" Any public official must exercise restraint and measured in the oral and written expression of his personal views. "
"This obligation does not concern the content of opinions (freedom of opinion is known to public officials), but their mode of expression."
and even: "This obligation continues to apply to suspended officers of their duties and availability."
ie a vacancy agent is still subject to duty reserve .... "
this is false: the "duty of reserve" does not exist in French law for officials of authority, and not for public servants in general.
Official authority: university president and director of high school, for example. But no college professor or high school or primary is not subject to any "duty of reserve" does not exist in French law
@Dzonokwa: But they are subject to professional discretion?
no
just read the legislation
I know for myself addressed this issue years ago, when the government was clear us that old sea serpent in order to silence the protests at university

I did mention that the official website

reserve duty, discretion and secrecy in public service | service-public.fr
Officials and non-permanent staff are subject to reserve duty. This requirement concerns the mode of expression of opinions and not their content. It more or less severe depending on the context and the place of the agent in the hierarchy. Officials and non-permanent staff are also subject to the discretion and secrecy professionals.
I am a civil servant, but no official authority, and I have the right to express myself without reservation on any subject when I want
yes but you do not cites the text of the law

the right of reservation does not guarantee the corruption in exchange for a position in the private.
In an interview published on the website Rue89, a magistrate recently said "n reserve duty not exist in the texts, c is a judicial creation. "She continued:" in the law, including the 1983 governing the civil service and Article 26, it is found that an imperative of professional discretion and hierarchical obedience. " And she concluded: "the whole question is where is the freedom of opinion and freedom of conscience in relation to this obedience." [1]
However, the duty of confidentiality is increasingly invoked in an attempt to cut off debate. And examples of officials punished for not having respected the in expressing itself publicly against the policies of their ministries, are more frequent. C is for example the case of a policeman, Jean-Hughes Matelly, and a police commander, Philippe Pichon. In national, Bastien Cazals Education, director of a kindergarten in the Herault, has been explicitly requested by the academy inspector 's no longer speak in the media. "
Anicet Le Pors that, as Minister of the Government of Pierre Mauroy Public Service from 1981 to 1984, led the development of the law n ° 83-634 of 13 July 1983 concerning the rights and obligations of officials, s is expressed this subject. In an article published on 1 February 2008, he said that their status gives freedom of opinion to public officials and that "the reserve requirement is not in the general status and, to [his] knowledge, in no particular civil servant status "

I just do not have the desire or the time to go ð
freedom of opinioln, but certainly the right to vote? if officials lose the right to vote while they were official.
well you do as you feel it, no problem, but thank you not to disseminate false information on a "reserve duty" that does not exist
France is not (yet) a dictatorship, to me it seems ...
@Dzonokwa "Spread misinformation" I just gave a link that comes from the source (the state) which itself return to a statute. I quoted from this link. And we were talking about the police reserve duty. I'm not an expert and have not claimed, I was only answering a question put to me. So good, "spreading misinformation" you repasseras ð

rho aut hey! No offense to you, but it is an area I've read so much misinformation and where misinformation is so much in the sense of criminalization of social movements, it is not citing a statute without dig the question that will be fine
uh, chaqun made his coffee washing ironing etc.
I'm not upset, I reframes things ^^ during a debate, it is important ð thank you anyway to have completed my knowledge!
vi vi, I have comprendu. I strongly reacted to the fact that you said they have neither the time nor the inclination to read text: not that right, in a debate!
