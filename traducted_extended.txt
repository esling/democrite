frankly I'll be honest, Chouard he's a good guy he has ideas but he is indoctrinated by his extreme right friends when he begins to speak of borders we sense that goes beyond its subject, criticizing globalism it is one thing but you have put your finger on specific items to get out of the fog
 by cons I recognize that it has merit to invest in its cause
 finally good because you stop talking about it, all is not throwing as many find common issues
Take a seat, anthony, settle down comfortably 
 Is not a subject that is not debate here I am comfortably thank you, haha
All is not good to take home Chouard, certainly
 Then keep only what brings us Sent, I hardly supports the inaccuracies then I will not let what I see: Etienne Chouard's borders especially in reading Debray "Praise border" which has nothing to do with a quote " right-wing indoctrination
@Reveur And what topics you that drives you?
me what bothers me is that countries such as France benefiting from weak currencies (eg in Africa) to steal the resources of this country
 what bothers me is that the last section of the preamble 46 is still not respected (CFA franc etc
) while it was inspired by a speech of 44 and the blood flowed, Africa has sacrificed his son for Europe and France and today they are treated as a sub-continent and me it gives me the creeps
 I watched the debate between firstly the economist and philosopher Fric Lordon and secondly anthropologist David Graeber
 I was impressed by their difference in that Lordon seemed to have a kind of political program (end of private ownership of means of production, for example) while Graeber simply wanted "to be left to the people to speak
@Reveur Yes that is what I say it critical for the eu borders too porous, as the extreme right
Jotting "as far right" allows to discredit the idea
 It is a form of sophistry useful to avoid substantive debate
xD I have to search half the words you use
Glad to raise the level Seriously, what bothers me in the first place is that there is inconsiderable number of injustices in this country
 In this sense, I fully support the idea of ??convergence of struggles
The trouble is converging but yes to what?
The question "what to bring together the struggles?" and I bring a solution in this post: https://pouvoiraupeuple
com/2016/04/14/le-point-de-convergence-des-luttes-mene-a-la-souverainete
The point of convergence of struggles leads to sovereignty
Fric Lordon said: "In France, someone who says that he is neither right nor left is invariably right, or right end
 "This injunction political commentators & # 821
this is not a disease to be left in general is assumed
good this time I'm really still dsl for the inconvenience bye
The problem is that say "left" or "right" or "center" does not suggest a popular solution, because it cleaves the people
 What I am advocating in this post is to put aside labels (eg I'm libertarian in terms of moral values ??but I do not put it forward because it is cleaving)
the problem is that to was in agreement must content
I do not wish to cleave a moral, but to unite on a meta-political struggle that is to say, a struggle that transcends current divisions and will allow us to unite on the type of social and institutional structures that we wish to see emerge
A left and right there are people who want to fight against neoliberalism, respect freedom of expression, save social security
these structures must be Dase on ideology, which has been determine
To determine and / or provide all the values ??and objectives that unite us, do not hesitate to participate on #projet_commun
hello brother, I am going there soon The only ideology that go away is one that temporarily puts aside all the others, by uniting to implement democratic meta-political structures we need
I just read a little up there anthony, the "end of private ownership of the means of production" is not an idea invented by Lordon, I do not know if it can reasonably qualify program
but it's that I'm not you, you can not determine "meta-democratic political structures we need" without ideological basis
"An ideology is a predefined system of ideas, also called categories, from which reality is analyzed, as opposed to an intuitive knowledge of perceived tangible reality
@ Homer242: thank you for this definition
 How do you succeed in extracting an ideology 'unique' by inspiring you to such thinkers: Franis Asselineau, Sylvain Baron, Aurien Bernier, Olivier Berruyer, Jean Bricmont, ienne Chouard Francis Cousin, Michel Collon, Franck Lepage Fric Lordon, Jacques Sapir Alain Soral?
must give power back to the people
 It seems to me a sensible reality perceived by all
It's simple: I center my reflection on the meta-policy
 That is to say, how one sets superior rules for operation of the democratic process
@Reveur: So write a new constitution
we are in democracy, we vote for those we want 
I think we can not speak of "democracy" without a fundamental critique of the values ??that support it
besancon: this is not a democracy, it is a plutocracy
Exactly, it's a plutocratic oligarchy
No, the system is each vote, and each vote has the same value
besancon: we vote for those that the most seen in the media
and the media guide the electoral battle
there are hundreds of ways to organize the votes and they influence the results
No this is the system that is illusory
 As long as we imagine voting to establish power over a majority, it will not change anything
 Majorities are already based on the established power
besancon: people vote as they are told
and there are mass influence techniques, I think of astroturfing (those who have access to research UNmotor be interested)
This will not change people will always suggestible
besancon: they are easily influenced because the system ensures that we are not interested in politics
that means everything and nothing impressionable, the problem is rather that a minority of dominant influence of a majority of dominated
us, our job is to work and then to repay the credit 
Hello everyone I am good coordination on the channel?
the mechanisms of mass influence are identifiable and possible to remove (I think the media held by the richest of the richest)
No, the problem is that many people prefer the matter to TV places to take tte on subjects of which they were not familiarized
if he does not prcupe is that their system plaient
 We can not have a democratic system if we stupefies watching TV and resigns what is happening in our neighborhood, city, region, country 
the television industries consciously play with the scientific knowledge of addiction to pleasure 
Feel free to carry on your conversations #blabla to facilitate the arrival of newcomers ^^
I think we need a system that puts the citizen in politics
if you see the audience as victims of images dealers, suddenly, they are far less responsible ^^
ah ok I arrived, I thought it was nice to be greeted with a debate
Perhaps you like me to come to the conclusion that leaving the majority choose is inefficase, essential questions are asked to people who know nothing there and it is expected that the most popular answer is the right
It will work well then we would desfois do something else
 If we force everyone to be active against the policy
 If one is educated from childhood
 It will be wall to a true democracy
besancon you see is what I suggested this idea permit vote
not you see, it is the logical consequence to a concrete problem
besancon: it is to qualify but I also see more elections as a power against (someone too unpopular will not be renewed) than a real exercise of power
besancon defends negative the appearance of a strong leader, which is the program of the extreme right, who tries, as we know, to direct the movement
 It starts from the recognition that we share (the vote does not) to bring us to "we need a leader who knows better than the others"
bordeaux: no, not a leader but a team dirigente 
for me democracy is not only of all exercise our power by the state apparatus but also to limit its power and guarantee civil liberties to organize ALSO in other forms of exercise of power as a demonstration night standing
VDSO thank you, I'm interested to me is how the fran it will coordinate and agree
 Can t have overcome egos to arrive at common points of convergence in a country like ours? What tools are in place to arrive at a common coordination between the different ag?
no management team will know better than me what life, and will have access to the creativity that comes from a group of intelligence
personally I think many people in this movement limit their political vision for a reform of the state and representative system as politics and power are also outside this framework
@galaad why France should it remain as it? We have known for some time that democracy works best in smaller groups, coordinate the whole France is to launch a challenge that we will be able to deal with much more experience
France is changing and evolving, there is today in every city people who are open ag to defend their rights, blocked the national scene, the problem and the major challenge (for me) is the coordination between all its ag and all his fights
 Can you do me by your conclusions in relation to the concept works best in small groups? it is not currently creating this experience and the reason for the cat?

An idea (already aired on https://gazettedebout
org/2016/04/16/les-mots-de-la-nuit): release of sovereign debt by the francs (Citizens Bank of France)
April 16, 2016 # 47mars, Injusticiables, Cyril
TAKING THE MEDEF AMIENS #onvautmieuxqueca #loitravail #cip #nuitdebout @ nuitdebout80 @medef
night person standing in support of periscope?
In the Constitution, stipulate that:
Citizen Bank of France only for notes and coins in francs redeemable against
In part against the Citizens Bank of France repays the capital of the SOVEREIGN DEBT (no interest, a way to punish wear use)
The Issuing Bank controlled francs seamlessly by citizens and led to the consensus of general assemblies votes, for example
This currency in francs, without credit card or check, that parts and against the Exchangeable Notes, promote an economy made up of peasants, artisans, small traders, independent citizens, and compete on home soil in their current use a currency that is not the black, they are francs
Moreover, once refunded sovereign debt, which would take its meaning in a democracy, this currency issued by Citizens Bank of France would fund a social policy (socialism) under the control of citizens who could vote in general meetings the main guidelines this policy funded by francs (not so in the voting booth) and apply when doing CONSENSUS
What do you think of this as socialism exercise of democracy?
I think we should make a great banquet and use the local currency as menhir, by cons must not prohibit the fresh fish
I am for real and not virtual currency
@stocky: if you do not like the banks, the franc will be done for you too

I love this kind of argument, or you agreed to internationalism, or you're a freak who wants to lock you up in a bunker and never tell anyone
@lucas_dev_paris: a currency exchange
 We went in after the attacks of 11 September 2001 (I think it attaches to an evil spirit)
 So already competing with the on its own soil, by use, it does not prevent the "trade" that can be done with other currencies, as long as the latter is accepted by of other banks, and it depends on the social credit, ie its use in society
 The key is to know that we want society
 I think globalism request to find limits and a currency promoting an economy of peasants, artisans, small traders, and independent (no CB or checks) would be a power-cons
I would say we should do as in america post intependance
I think this is already the case in Switzerland too
 View full currency initiative to give exclusivity to the currency issue to a national bank
yes this is the case you got the SNB which prints the private banks but the system is the same as with the Bank Europeen
If we use that come francs a Citizens Bank (managed and directed by the citizens) voluntarily (by sacrificing for the Franks) who collected with reimburses the capital of the sovereign debt, at least we know what stick: using francs we free of debt, it opens in the future
a way of return (reverse?) the problem

what not, I know the more countries that have ressis to repay this debt

I find absurd ca to compete with the euro as another currency managed by the state
 for me it is indeed one liberalizes currency or local currency is made as @stocky said either we return to the franc and leaving the euro
Varoufakis wanted to launch a plan in the genre with a Greek local currency remaining in the euro but nobody followed, in my opinion because of this fact is equivalent to leaving the euro
@lucas_dev_paris: the franc will not be managed by the state but by a French citizen bank, to see how it works (its constitution)
@ Corentin592_dev_londres: yeah when I hear back a former France small artisans and small farmers 
 take switzerland, countries as international banks such ca is not credible
@lucas_dev_paris: I do not take the example of Switzerland, but thought that it develops around the full currency initiative
the problem is that out of 30 years of opening borders with the results we know
@cyrildelacour: yes but it would have a monopoly on the local currency, which would be guaranteed by the state, otherwise it is the liberalization of currency and I do not believe either you defend ca
it is being discussed on the losing Romain now such
@stocky: eme It seems that is the Sweden or Norway who has no debts and has regained growth
open borders this ne'st not bad either
the Vatican bank also has a right?
how? From 2008 it condemned and imprisoned banker (as we subsidizing them with public money)
the vatican is connected to the bank of Italy
@stocky: yes there was also major scandals on the bank of the Vatican
@stocky: no, the opening abroad is enriching (or risky), but we suffer from excesses, then we must develop alternative

after the bankers are not necessarily aware they doing shit
Why is growth so necessary that we impose in the name of competitiveness at solidarity prices, it requires the sacrifice of living?
Would this not to honor the interests that fund?
This wear, as a means to parasitize the economy and as favorable to a minority principle that the passage nothing "socialist" as the foundation of capitalism, allows money to make money, not only in contempt of work, but also our social and especially so natural environment
So to not be compelled to growth or to war, do we not outlaw usury, starting money creation?
Must still be sovereign to decide, but our democracy is deprived of sovereignty by usurpers
To understand this we must be aware of what the value placed in the measure of all things instead of keeping measure in everything, tearing the darkness that surrounds the creation of money and why so many sacrifices are made
It is not easy and even a banker shows its difficulty understanding what money is
 So here's a lesson in democracy by a Swiss banker: https://youtu
When children fight over a toy and because I do not like lying to them: "I do not believe in Santa Claus, if the toys belong to the dispute, confiscated!" They understand and learn autonomy in setting their own conflicts
 I just reminded them the function of a toy (the first property)
The first function of money was to facilitate trade, and now it is a means by usury, appropriating and reserve riches while imposing a form of slavery through debt
In this insurrectionary period (as many prefects and for a while now, and for example with #NuitDebout movement) many slaves are ready to repress other slaves to the money, but it should not be more royalist than the King?
The fact is that cash is king, sovereign debt, the fallen people, very fallen!
We are plutocracy, we are not a democracy
But the plutocracy can be born democracy, as the venom antidote
Keep in mind that a tree does not sell fruits, money is not vital
Specifically how to make money an antidote?

Well basically leave the state only create money, that will prevent abuse of the banks
ben ca is a bank, even if it is public servants who manage

it is a chemical equation, there will always be people who want to enjoy, there will always be people who will not be benefited
@stocky: prevention is better than cure: this new constitution Citizens Bank of France
This is not the French bank, but the bank of AGs, nuance

I note that the periscope Romain Leclerc it was about (money) in Paris Republic Square just a few minutes 
#breakingnews radiodebout has decided to close its site, I do not know any more for the moment
So it would in addition Citizen Bank of France is decentralized (see cybernetic principles), so dependent on general meetings (plural): a new praxis
for me it would be enough to let the European Central Bank the possibility of inflation, because basically it is ca debate on austerity and independence
no need to overhaul the whole system and destroy the EU in passing in my opinion
@lucas_dev_paris: better to let the franc to citizens and usurers, these vultures!
moreover they started last year it seems to do quantitative easing
@lucas_dev_paris: I have not personally "advantage" of printing money (scriptural writings) European, but instead I see his misdeeds

I know it would hurt the ass and hurt Macbook two or three people Repub 'to go, but it would not hurt to involve those most concerned, right?

you defend Freemasonry through which it must pass (at one time?), according to Holland, when one believes in their republic? https://youtu

I simply said that she really existed
Wow, you really want the media in general, you know there's not that bad huh journalists

Well, I thought you were conspi less' than that and less interneto-centered, so I'll resign myself, not to join and continue throwing cobblestones at random throughout the world, unfortunately
@satanicwarmaster: Media form the first power because they spread beliefs that prevail
Fortunately there Google the great oracle to tell the truth always, right?
eg "propaganda is to release the wear is at its reference shareholder"
It may well be good journalists, your speech is not good to hear you, we should all take is the discourse of fascists
Even good journalists must adhere to a media field in poor condition
@satanicwarmaster: no, we have to stop believing the lies broadcast on TV for example, the most effective is to have no TV 
theguardian are some nice they helped snowden xD
That does not stop to accept bias, people can judge and think for themselves, you know everyone is not stupid in this world
The problem is not journalism, but conivence with power, men of power 
 The links of politicians with the bosses of the 'trusts' media
 So suddenly the editorial lines are very far from what is called information, and closer to the propagade as it is filtered and serve interests foremost
If there were not good journalists I have nothing knew about this movement 
 I am shocked to know that you are also organized
Elelinde, how do you explain that you learn every day on this or that man / political party

Mediapart for years that I tanned them with this: undeclared work (with the complicity of Mediapart also therefore) children to the cinema, that is "justice"? It condemns the father who is opposed by removing parental authority, in the harassing

I'm not talking about Freemasonry, but it actually party like banks, countries, etc
the guy who speaks usurer while rates have never been lower 
but it is the pitch that freaks me Cyril It looks to me like a crazy hair
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit the Qur'an strongly condemns usury, and even announced a war Would you talk about these suras, or Islamic finance?

ouch Usurers this ruse, it wears users!
@cyrildelacour: Islamic finance, you speak of the guys who pay with their Amex Centurion at 20%?
1% interest, this ruse, this ruse,

3% interest, this ruse, this ruse,
3% interest, that cunning usurers!
Should perhaps remove them the privilege of money creation, right?

@stocky: This is an Amex Centurion
 It is provided by invitation only, after an initial payment of 5000 USD and annual fees of 2500USD
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: I do not know, I know the suras that condemn usury as follows (I am a Christian): 275
 Those who eat [practice] of usury will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of the touch of Satan upset
 This is because they say: "Trade is just like usury," but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury
 He, therefore, ceases as soon as it came an admonition from his Lord, may retain what he has previously acquired; his case is for Allah
 so these are the people of the Fire! They will abide therein
 Allah will deprive usury and made almsgiving fruitful
 And Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner
 O you who believe! Fear Allah; and give up what remains of usury, if you are believers
 And if you do not, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger
 And if you repent, you shall have your capital
 You lerez person, and you will not be wronged
Personally I know that theory does not always mean practice

@cyrildelacour: what's the difference?
@cyrildelacour: one can imagine an Islamic bank managed by the french, finally there is the word that changes
are already cooperative banks, what is the difference with a citizens bank?
@stocky: bank managed by the French who use the money "frank wear" is an idea
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: it strikes the currency "national"

live music of all, it is not always cheaper

in Switzerland, they are all from Swiss cows make milk and cuckoos exist

Swiss it benefit both the "situation" but shhh eh! we love them we will b **** well
c true, they do not mix, so you can listen to 5 and change daily
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: ca is actually creating tension
It still lacks the famous survey wave 
Swiss Monaco Luxembourg Andorra etc
you do not just prevent immigration

Well I was referring to the discussion in the same place yesterday around 17 / 18h it seems to me ^^
do not return the foreign criminals should be kept here in prison
there is more room in French prisons
it is against the human rights to add more people there
necessarily, it puts guy for smoking a joint or sold weed in small quantities
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: the most funny is that the government closed non prisons?
It is not even basic super smart to pile up, ditto for hospitals, dilute the problems that are solved more or less 
allowed their assets they live in without piss people 
 the banks have little to be ca 10% of assets in paris should be enough
You know a lot of weed smoker in jail, you ???
@stocky: they closed I think the most unhealthy
and what to sell 3 strips ca deserves prison?
I worked in health (which was a prison)
people should not look you a tote accused the banks is a problem yes but it's not just because of the Swiss or countries that have money
we're not in jail for selling 3 bars today in France, it takes a lot more than that, especially recidivism
No he just play the game of the room and it works well for them Swiss
yeah we're going to jail when you get aggresser boxed for example 
should not defend himself in France eh
This time the prison, I tend to believe those who have "lived" the thing more or less, because trust what is said like that, the "one says" 
in my opinion your current problems is ca historic date of crap that there was during the French Revolution
and banks, prisons etc are only effects
hmm this is not entirely wrong in so far as many of the current state process are from the revolution
the problem does not come from the revolution, at least I think not

everything depends on parameters not?
Which was tested there a long time successfully in ancient Greece it seems not?
Aix: Yes but it will not pass in the head because of the people-the Greeks had slaves
 they had the steam engine but they did not care because-they had slaves
be it a player or elbows jacky the PMU, which puts full excavation with the money I care little lobby
JACKY PRESIDENT! yes ancient greece had the steam engine JAmes watt fuck you
@Cmoi: An artificial intelligence that is arbitrary and in addition it obscured the trick
about Athenian democracy, it is widely referenced in this docu
I HAVE NOT VOTE - FULL MOVIE -STFR-ENG - 46 min
IT gives a power that should not be overlooked
@Cmoi: No I do not see a political system that you can explain to a child is a bad system
you can explain the data analysis can be a child? I dunno
@Cmoi: Ca your thing looks a bit like Skynet in Terminator 
ca policy should be by all comprehenssible
good in any case it is futuristic but it's not too out of it to be "good" while Greece it had market
Rousseau was favorable in the draw
@Cmoi: The data analysis is not neutral, ever
Otherwise, there are no worries about putting video links here?
a computer is UNABLE to get the go Oh and if you calculate the worker dying on average a year XX XX the framework etc
you create an example pension calculation on sales
@stocky: (re) we are human, political animals (the time we live in "society" Politicians are they doing in the jargon, this is because their policy is not to be understood
force workers dying on average younger they should have higher wages
@Cmoi: And after you decide what?
ca pointless to calculate pensions if one has an unconditional basic income
and after you let the bot do the algos on other issues
Yet a different vision of the "debt crisis", ca talking about Belgium, but it can be done parallel with all European countries without difficulty https://www
And if we stopped paying! Interview with Olivier Bonfond
you create an advice if the thing is too enflame to block too bizarre laws
@Cmoi: Politics is not a figure deal
and a reset button if ca hand too far voiila
the world is crazy, stay up stand up for your rights
well if it's just a figure of history actually
@Cmoi: The machine is faster than the human is not possible
@Cmoi It will appeal the Constitutional Council are corrupt
like robot that calculates the stock market and that are crap and which have seizures
me the story of power is just a trick of animals for ca 
 humans are not good the top saw their origins
@Sent: Book the politician volunteers to function?
@Cmoi: The algos they create by whom?
not stocky, robots who calculated the course of the scholarships are not shit
an algo a goal and did it already becomes political
An assembly of people who are drawn, compensation, regularly renewed with one vote each
you publish a crappy stuff on twitter and your robot it is Chutter your country @Cmoi
why optimize such thing rather than another
do you want to make a record of the proceedings in a pad?
the computer must constantly take decision to have a solution that fits properly around his case
Aix: how fair and impartial? I would say that it depends on the decision, in an emergency or not, etc
Yes stocky normal well you publish a crappy stuff on twitter your course will go down anyway
@Cmoi: Then imagine a policy with robots that analyze people, they just people trollent
well you create an open source with a comprehensible and understandable algo params
then indeed artificial intelligence is fun, it helps to globalize, but there's always a purpose and that is toujour mess
For the priorities they must then refocus on local democracy
 Such territory has it as a priority, another that
kind pretend to do burn out? to die?
@Cmoi: Gender everyone says that there will be a war to laugh, and the robot analyzes ca and it sends missile with whomever
I speak just of arduous work and income
someone wrote a report has subsequently
@Cmoi:'ll See what it is that the basic income
the revenue base is like the RSA?
@Cmoi: Precisely for this that you can use the decision aid, but the algorithm will not decide in your place that is best for you
this is not an income given to all without @Cmoi condition to have enough to live on and live with dignity
but no one has little to be the "sensor well be!"
at the base is standing for radio chat
@Cmoi: With a fuzzy concept like this, it will be fun
yeah well that's not what nimporte? Custom I stopped to work if I have an unconditional income
I admit it's good but it's not sustainable
@ Juju29: I put it or then? Below?
@Cmoi: A "sensor well be" I would say money, otherwise we are "sensitive" (more or less)
Perhaps it is necessary to create another
@Cmoi: Everyone says AC and in fact there have been surveys and the majority of people would continue to work because-you mad when you anything you need to do something,
I confess to the algorithm is not the time, but again in a few dozen years
but I think a mind map could be more interesting
@stocky: bad people not bump, bump indeed
I can give you lessons if you want @ Juju29: we gossiped on another chan about this?
@Cmoi But as you are a minority you pose no problem to the system of basic income
@stocky: besides there are plenty of people who bump currently in republic
@Cmoi: Ca has been tested and it works

becaufe I propose to give 1 billion has all the french
Is it possible to create a channel currency / basic income / finance for example?
this would be an opportunity to get involved in citizen initiatives, take the time to learn an artistic practice simple examples 
Aix: perhaps there is already enough channels right?
@Cmoi: Money has the value that we give him is that piece of paper or vacuum often
@Cmoi: Tax, tax, robots do not need money to work
@Cmoi: Ca are suede, ireland, saudi saoudie 
but is used for another purpose, dominate
I see here that "Home" and "communication", there is another channel list?
@Cmoi: Suede it what? in Germany as there are tests
ireland tax refund throughout europe the cash flows afloat
AC germany astonish me the universal income
the problem with this basic income history / salary for life and all that, is that it is far, far too far
 I do not say unthinkable, but it is more a horizon line than anything else
 There are things to work much closer to us
in short, we must stop thinking that the relationship between money and work is direct

@lomjuju admins amaury, and other nemolivier
yeah unconditional income is very difficult or impossible
like that the proposals and what emerges could be said to the AG or the other republic
impossible in the state can be, but it deserves to be considered, saying that it will not be useless
and even if it seems unlikely, I prefer people who think about it, rather than people who comment not touch my post
people they march the room, they want more than the neighbor
it's too easy to say "impossible"
@Cmoi It's wrong I'm not like that
ben you're not representative of the population while
@Cmoi: Unconditional income? Swiss speak by nationalizing their banks and by reserving the monopoly of money creation: full currency initiative (soon vote)

@yeno: a what? I did not understand
(When you say "the France is one")
@yeno: and yet until recently France was a country not so badly off even for these citizens, it smells good scenario for the Greek now
@Cmoi: It is not impossible to sell things while having a basic income:,)
it is not sitting on our ass to the account at the end of the year and bingo
a favored country, which does not mean much indeed, but France is beautiful is an international power (on lots of areas that I disapprove of course, but are there)
yes I see, but not abuse hyper relativism
are necessarily worse or better than we
yes, it's a bit where I was getting too and this is not a reason for not wanting better
if you can read, you have a smartphone and a credit card you are part of the 0
ok people I have two things to say
do not fall into the trap of electronic voting is a bullshit
Then think carefully about the basic income super important ce'st
@Cmoi: Without wanting to disappoint you credit cards and smartphone that will use a lot in the world
the poor can not be a smartphone for electricity but it is probable
@stocky I also think monaitaire question is one of the main nerves of the war between peoples and elites exploitative, internationally
I prefer an online referendums system (electronic? blockchain?) that the current voting system, which electronically or not is completely locked
@stocky: general meetings, the concept of democracy in action?
but I have inflamed me with the 0
@Cmoi: I think yes @cyrildelacour:
"400 million smartphones shipped in the last quarter 2015," a small stat I just perceive
@stocky: by against Internet is a tool to discuss and pass laws for example
 But this vote would have to be as secure as CB 
@stocky: I love the operation of AG who stand up for the Republic: Democratic praxis
@cyrildelacour: If you want to hope that continues DEMOCRACY does not rely on IT
In any event, even a citizen vote parfais without popular education and independence of the media, ca return to the same
 It will make you vote for the same vaseline today
@cyrildelacour: IT is controlled by humans, and if one day we made machine that can think for them same, it will still be limited or exterminate it
@stocky: yes, I rather on account of citizens for democracy (local in his exercise then the federation of local democracies)
hence the relevance of open source chat rooms, free expression, the list is long
@stocky: I think it's a bit against productive science fiction

 "maximum of n and male citizens" 
 it will not, I'm not citizens and do not recognize any legitimacy to the institutions that ensues 
 can put "maximum earthling and earth" 
 it changes many things for many of us this notion
"A more participatory democracy" 
 A democracy any court, "participatory implies that we amount already in democracy 
 it is a big problem of substance by form
And what is this frenzy of "Citizen standing
 In order to make the proper judgment, pursuant to Article XII of the
Declaration of Rights of Man and of the Citizen
we redo the same as Babylon, is that the program 
 It is certainly a joke in bad taste this "flyer"
fr/images/b/b0/Communique_accueil_Nuit_Debout_imprimable
s democracy and I share the same opinion as you
 In drafting the statement we made the choice to take the words in their ordinary meaning (sense Newspeak if you prefer) and discreet irony underline their true meaning: a citizen makes policy
 A democracy that is not truly participatory is not one
This choice was made because the purpose of the statement is not to bring the claims to change the political system but to report on Night Stand to the attention of the general public through the media, so we need to talk about their code 
Otherwise the reference to Article 12 it is the comic spring (two defining judge: opinion and judicial) and is used to refer to police violence (that make us laugh yellow)
Of course these choices are open to criticism and that's why I thank you for your return

@cyrildelacour: yes, a reaction, the only truth of this conspi video is that the DNS belongs to the company Raiz, a member who is part of the movement
 The domain name will be transferred to something else, association, organization, it is difficult to choose, ustement for trust issues, transparency, but we already have with us companies that are blameless in this Point (squaring the net, open democracy now), but the transfer is not done in one day, because you have to evaluate everything
 The NDD was filed in emergency for the movement, to be sure coke and other enlarge your penis take, or a guy to sell T shirt
 Then the "conspiracy" side "fascho" the thing is completely stupid
 you can see here in ls dev channel, digital etc 
 that all decisions are taken among 300 people, in front of 1500 people, for digital, there is no particular authority setting from the difficulty of ensuring that everyone can learn from the advanced digital projects, and can vote and participate, but the process and the will are there
 So video = conspi, moron, political division, hoax

Good evening to you all I want to know if the movement will continue until July?
Singapour @! We hope it will continue, but unlikely in this form (we already slashed all ^^)
In my view, we can not be sure, links between the participants in Night Stand have been created already, they will surely continue, however, the movement in its current form, as said pierrelalu, may not continue (in this form )
Socrates: all night, it's a little hard for the organizers 
n Still, I am hopeful that the movement continues! especially with the sunny days arrive! (By cons, I have more doubts about its survival this winter ?)
paris: ok! do you mean by "I do it again?"
IMHO it lasts for, it'd be interesting to go down the proposals that begin to emerge wiki So ultimately there would need more members if I understand?
For me it is the solution Socrafte By increasing the number of people, it enhances the "rotating capabilities" so it allows people to this rest and motivate each other Socrafte

paris @: Yes, adding the event ok thank you
 But then relay the agenda "official" 
@nathaniel: Committee for Drugs and freedom, I invite you to reflect on the fact that a drug user, including hard drugs, he made a conscious choice about the use of his body against the occult that the health system is shared, and therefore it imposes on other choices
 This is even more true for cigarettes and alcohol
 Indeed the issue of public health, its cost and virtuous practices, this is the kind of topic that can be debated
Lille: By "conscious choice" you also hear that what led him to drug use is a choice on his part?
Paris: I answer their first report: https://wiki
fr/wiki/Villes/Paris/Drogues_et_libert%C3%A9/CR/16_avril
Cities / Paris / Drugs and freedom / CR / 16 April NuitDebout
which reads in part: Motion 1: 'The Committee considers the use of psychotropic drugs as a right to dispose of his body, of his conscience and of his privacy
Motion 2: "The commission denied the prohibition of access to the plant and its free use
Motion 3: "The Commission considers the right to access a non-ideological information and prevention anxious to education and public health
Motion 4: "The Commission denies that a user can be pursued by the police and justice

Paris: unfortunately I'm not Parisien and can come and talk Ok, I note your point to the next agenda if you book me a clear title
 @nathaniel: You have a cat here?
@nathaniel: and suddenly, you can convey an idea: if drug users make a conscious choice, then they declare to the health pooling system, and must contribute more to rebalance things
 That must in my view be part of the conscious choice made, plus it is educational about the dangers of drug use
 Can be extended to other hazardous substances such as alcohol or cigarettes elsewhere
Lille @: ah yes good idea and we do that also for big!
(What it takes sometimes to hear)
paris not only I did not say, but I did not even think
Lille: but why? overweight people because of their food choices are costly to the health pooling system, so I do not understand why you patronized some and not others
 But to answer you: in a legal system there are taxes that are used to it, simply
 Then when you take The US case states that have legalized weed, the collected money windfall tax takes more than well the health, and can even be made available for education or other public service
Why The War on Drugs Is a Huge Failure
@nathaniel: yes, it can be done like that too, but the tax system also allows a parallel system of black market (I have not said I was against, I said that we must take in account ^^) Moreover, the cost of smoking to society is not offset by what it pays in taxes, so you must also think of balancing
fr/planete/article/2016/04/19/l-onu-acte-l-echec-de-la-guerre-contre-les-drogues_4904685_3244
The UN document the failure of the war against drugs
The special session of the United Nations General Assembly would focus prevention and care
paris: eating remains a vital need
 We do not choose to eat but what you eat
 By against drugs, we choose well (according to the commission) to consumption
 This is where I put the distingo
 Free for you to disagree, but thank you not to go too fast and taxing me like children
Come on, it's nice but it's not the place to debate, good day to you
@nathaniel: good evening and good commission ^^
Lille: eating 8000 calories a day is not a vital need!
Lille: you also chosen to eat healthy or shit, this has a cost (the most important of all there 
), thus taxing the food that makes you sick, so it seems a good idea
Do you really think that the `channel accueil`soit the place to debate?
But how to explain that drugs that do not make you sick are prohibited and those that cause illness are "encouraged", at least very very present (industry, advertising, lobbies)
Lille We talk Saturday! As the Committee has no assigned chanel, I took home to share my ideas
 Indeed, this is not the place, that's why I started a private conversation with Sam ^^
Lille and let's create that channel and share the wiki page on the Committee I invite Nathaniel to do so since it is part of the commission

No but also the text we want to have a tab for membership as a Night Stand and activist in the text
there is a page that returns to the wiki
then: small legal point: sign petition via personal email address (even if you share) = Banned
small point coordination: Toulouse look with they have an ope but not the same day I think
wiki can not do anything @chercherjournal?
Every day there are thousands to occupy public space to take our place in the Republic
 Join us, and decide together our common future in this political movement or party without banners
wiki can not add the nights standing signatory
finally developed redac: attention at the formula "members of France 
 "FA" (unfortunately it has not yet true of AG off individual cities, d hence the risk of telescoping - as the example with the motion of Toulouse I quoted above
you can link to an external petition, and link to the page that will list the signatories?
(Digital-ethics intercommission also the matter of the petition tool in the viewfinder, see @ PM56)
Yes but if you put the text on the wiki bordeaux, the motion will not be very visible
so we would like it to appear in the news or other
@chercherjournal: besides, I did a little research in my corner for Bordeaux
 What's this site ? http://nuitdeboutbordeaux
Hello: is it possible to include the holding of the COMMISSION Antipub to 19h to Sated now, the program Night Stand? I unable to know who to ask

Night Stand: the offensive in the safe | Club Mediapart
Within weeks, the most important social movement consisting of the last 10 years in France, s is literally emptied of its substance subversive to take the form of a friendly alternative village and ultra-connected
 At a time when neoliberal purge n has never been violent, it is urgent to reset the political struggle rather than creating a new Christiania
Creating change through strikes and demonstrations? I think that create / think a more likely alternative system to emerge that if asked, through popular pressure, a change is as strange about
The main criticism seems to be based on the policy definition in this article
I fear for the result of the movement with the extension of state of emergency
after, if we avoid leaving stupidities in Media Share (Isan)
it should be fine, it is an extraordinary social laboratory where meetings are created, exchanges or knowledge sharing as a common good
the people on the ground trying the best possible dissemination of knowledge, know-how and know-be promoting exchanges and meetings
to highlight as all the already existing devices, the participatory democratic jobs in different government bodies
as soon as the "zu" have decided to give time to the social animator, digital, territorial to come on the ground and fair job paid by our taxes, ca advance in the right direction
 people who gather in committee to discuss and comment on various topics 
 share a coffee or beer with a buddy, moaning and grabbing from time to time 
@ondortlejouronboitlanuit: fear does not avoid danger
fear in the sense gatherings will be banned in the name of security
and suddenly, the movement will make pschit
If this is really the name of security, the euro is also banned as a rally

he painfully tries to keep the topic of debate but a lot of people have nothing to carrer come and just tell them little stammers, unrelated
why fakir monopolizes the project #nuitdebout and discredit the work of the AG?
@all why fakir monopolizes the project #nuitdebout and discredit the work of the AG?
they do not discredit, the meeting at the labor exchange is symptomatic of a ruffin side is fighting to stay in the concrete and make things "hard", while the other half of the speakers are there to come and preach to their parish as if it were the free speaking at the GA
they are two different visions that attempt to discuss but it does not work
no, he monopolizes the projection of #nuitdebout in 2min AG would have been as tt the world
Yes, and why he ferauit the agenda of the GA?
this is not an AG, I repeat, it is an evening debate which is proposed here
"He would make the agenda of AG" xD
He could not say that, if @LoGduPerigord?
yes I also repeat myself how is it that an external commission meeting to make proposals to the agenda of the GA?
they are proposals, the discussion evening will bring its proposals and work with the AG as any commission
fakir is huge in its own committees and discuss with unions
therefore recognizes the sovereignty of the AG
where I could possibly join the questioning @LoGduPerigord is the perception - again - when the mass media will transcribe
 They are likely, as usual, to ignore that it is of "proposals"
yes while baffouant the right to speak in the meeting and imposing its schedule to submit the next?
ok, well, we understood that you did not like the fakir, I personally think nothing of them, but in this case they behave correctly in the Democratic field
you think what you want, I consider it a privilege
@LoGduPerigord: If you have written references the above I take out a small package of bonds to be processed by the communication team
I have not said that I did not like fakir, I see a private press which gives it the right to propose agendas and meetings parallel to AG
yes good will, if you will, is a dirty fascist ruffin go
if it freezes it s'trouve babies as the bastard
question: Does he said fakir speaks in his own name or in the name of fakir?
I'm not saying this is a fascist, I say fakir takes the decision to propose an agenda for all ag and discussions with unions

me if this does not bother you and you do see any problem is you're really blind to the slap just given to AG FRAnce and Navarre
ah yes but it can not impose it in all settings - as there not a c AG, osef I say?
if fakir wants enact other rules than the AG for the operation of the debate, they have the right
the free night standing not to participate
BYou two interpelations at Lille following a CRS raid on trade union premises, in reaction, this following direct action of an individual "third party" that launched a brick through a window 
but especially not should descend
fakir came to despise the work of AG
@LoGduPerigord what everyone here has not _seulement_ privilege being able to listen 
we had a little visit mirc57 re bernard-1, you know?
except that here it was really decided @ SurViValS
Brest tried to do her knight big heart, @ Espion
Tournai managed to smuggle without too much trouble, and then I have / pawn
who better than Lordon, piketti and appalled economists to talk about the economy, who better than ruffin or Plenel to talk about history of protest movements and so on in other areas
 the Republic of ag that's nice, but the opposite camp is not in lyric poetry then will have to talk seriously on a day when the other
so he tried to balk and saloper the hotline, but there it ended up falling on the bones of small admin good
a representative of ag remarked that ag have a project to suggest the contrary of what to ruffin said in his speech and the meeting of May 7 and 8, that ruffin is eager to take the floor to say must progress on the project proposed fakir, poof, gone the work of ag
@ Spermwhale-1: vazy you dirty GA lxD
ruffin just as ag had no short-term future project, which is false
suddenly (I keep telling the @amaury evening) I think @ Vecu
Paris @diego and are cursing me for things that do not advance
to put forward its proposal on 1 May
about @kraft it must be always on his bike to try to arrive on time
the ag decided an international meeting on 7 and 8 May
hey ben listening, if people are not happy, and Ruffin fakir will send bouler in the vote in AG and it will remain there
there's nothing to be indignant to the Holy AG
it's up to you, I share you my feelings, you can do what you want, and especially to ignore
Excellent he had not missed me the script kidies
and the foot is placed in the murky pond of bureaucracy, sovereignty and institutions of power, it's great
but he learned of the sudden archive its empty channel
@LoGduPerigord: This is not surprising, I feel that one of the concerns of the movement it is probably exaggerated fear recovery from each other

the ag decided an international meeting on 7 and 8 May
the ag also recovered ruffin film
the problem here is obvious, fakir impose his agenda his word facing the AG, it could be fakir or any other media group, but it is the press so that his ideas prpose AG
it's not who wakes up one morning to protest a republic
we must also recognize the activist work and stop talking about Recycling
So without distinction, all the press is rotten and has no legitimacy when in any discourse on equity night stand?
well then to compare, fakir has much more to bring the movement in terms of struggles that the Curb
@LoGduPerigord: Fakir well as impose its agenda on 31 March, we not to make a fuss
LoG: we are still waiting a documentary source on the "Fakir IMPOSED the AG"?
cergy: tou myou plI note that a newspaper group acts as a think tank, made his Lobbie, its prpores discussions with the trade unions for its project, deal with representing ag ag reminding that have their project and have not wait to be told what to do
and in terms of implementation and effectiveness of the movement, I would have to give voice to M6 even if the subject is not distorted and if it makes a profit Night Stand
it seems that people do not want intellectuals (though ESSENTIAL to creating a climate for minimum pre-revolutionary, read brothel history of books) or "professionals" of the struggle (and I'm not talking unions)
lol @ spermwhale-1 which takes us her accent too glamorous!
ben ok, that night was standing derde then, and continue to dream AG looped over the lifetime income
at least the intentions are clear for everyone

we discussed the debate just before
Apparently: @LoGduPerigord and mortarshell
Ok, is there a way for me to return to an earlier point when I arrived in the chat?
@diego we need a clean pickup and ask to bind in UP news on 
Yes, I found fakir very arrogant with respect to representing ag
Custom I took during the debate, but not long after it began, the worse when I saw that it was going to do anything, I went to do my dishes
: there is a "History" button in the left column 
_cherche his personnel_ translator
and when I returned, it was always as much a mess
_It must be Maque with the steed of amaury_
it means fakir prpose nuitdebout meeting and union May 1

@ Spermwhale-1 was a formulation of the spirit, not the letter ^^
Well, I see that your conversation that evening debate has revolved around the potential preemptive Fakir on the AG
I have not listened to, but the quality of the retransmission seems to me quite horrible
J was in a 2 week InterComm and c clearly a big problem they will not take to the m

To which New World takes us Night Stand?
To continue to occupy the land and consolidate its legitimacy privileged place of public debate, the movement began to develop a "cultural" program with film screenings and concerts
hell, they will eventually make us think that the people have perhaps more the right to consider as people I find his relevant analysis
At least it has the merit of explaining why ND takes so well to a certain part of the population and not for another
I can not see someone with critical spirit refuse ND
 Unless caught by capitalism perhaps
(Or fainntisme, defeatism, jenfoutisme)
Tournai: I think the sentence should understand "assert its position as a leader" (if I translate in corporate Newspeak) and not to implicate it should not exist

"But perhaps most importantly its ability to exceed this opening between itself Franis Ruffin question posed itself, resulting in absences for less glaring in the concerns of the movement, as the issue of migrants, that of suburban youth as the most popular categories, particularly of those who have been tempted by the protest embodied by the FN vote
Uh, but it's wrong, these matters precisely due to each AG and each session of free speech
@diego: even in that sense, I'm struggling
 ND is not leading, ND is the expression of the people (or at least partially)
 What ND wants is "the people" who wants it, right ??
(And those who do not agree are part ^^)
Tournai: The author takes the look of a sociologist and in his article in no time denigrates ND, he just tries to study - relatively neutral - the social dynamics that drive the movement
 And his reasoning is worth being followed I think
Personally I understood: ND has similarities May 68 May 68 but where was the union of youth and workers, ND seems to be the union of youth and an expanded middle class ( middle class since its creation became politicized [the sense of the term] finally)
But given your reactions I had to misunderstand
The question is to know at what point we consider that the integrated movement of the working classes
Tournai: ND is not the people, ND is the portion of the people who believes in ND project
 ND is not my family, not my friends, it's not 
(I mean my family and friends are against ND)
The BanlieueDebout movement, the presence of ND workers in cities is rather a good sign
 The difficulty is whether there is a popular support behind, it's not easy to be determined
@diego: in general, it's the same for me too 
 but I think that people either do not seek to understand / get involved or are easy excuses 
Frankly, when I see social struggles throughout history, and the importance they have for the future 
It all began 3000 years ago when the Egyptian workers decided to refuse to work because they are not remunerated 
A famine, hundreds of deaths, months without work 
 And the beginning of social rights ??
@inkey: Besides, is what you have information on Standing Suburbs? The media try to make it look like white bobos meetings and conclude the operation to fail on the grounds that the suburbs consist mainly of racialized individuals
 What does return to the reality?
Tournai: you can also try to understand but do not find their account, or find the relevant movement
or you have me appear to have exchanged important insights from 21h, someone to make me a rough summary before 10am tomorrow?
the _avant 10am en_ poilifttiquement having a strategic nature

 Parcontre I think it is not really just a white bobo meeting, this has got to brew Association / local militant therefore not necessarily the corner of the bourgeoisie

Tournai: There is a difference between "is against ND priori" and "would be to ND provided you have enough information," I agree
 But it does not change that at present the majority of the population is not found in ND ((primarily because it rejects a priori ND)) ND therefore can not claim to represent the people - for now

No, I see castes, as for the word people, I always heard as a disguise that put the poor to own in salons, is a patriot in wartime, to put them at the front

castes exist in France when your parents are too poor to go to college, they already bled to pay you your school books, then college? go work

@LoGduPerigord: I apologize BUT I absolutely can not let you compare some derminimes acting now in France with "caste"
It's hard to follow you ben Yet there it's lived, I talk to you years of agricultural slaves 50-80 French
the concept of "caste" referring to the Hindu model, for which a majority of French did not even necessary balls to try to decipher the democratic development
I talk to you workers, I can tell you about the worker son
the experience certainly, but then under "slave-masked" - not "caste"
c CCA great, you just need a term that is not caste
that Hugo already termed as social reproduction cf miserable
(Because caste is based on assumptions that are shared even by discriminated castes

 Unlike those big wankers who have become unemployed and have what they deserve!

it's funny, I was talking with my man just now to the idea of ??removing the legacy to improve equity and reduce disparities rich / lean x)
yes, inheritance is a result of not changing
xD, troll @amaury / out and go #action = but leave me my hard-earned dough ^^
@LoGduPerigord: Should we be interested in hearing from the "inheritance" - was not just my material
yes, I read but I have not had access to college at 18 and 1 Service work, shit because not graduate 
 and you chained to repay the debts of your parents, and that is making you do never put aside money for a house so rent, and your wages just enough
 but this is not my story, I have many / friends like that in neighboring province
@ LoG your question, I'm not sure but yes I think "social determinism" or "individual" covers well the whole problem
It's a beautiful day starts here but if that 6:30

I have the verb to talk about because I read, and I removed the ordis early, but how about me do not even have that

Hi, I have the impression that the movement is weakened?
I disconnected republic, I had got used to watch direct, but then nothing
the program does not indicate for Friday
irl: I found it disconcerting not to attend the conference today at the Bourse du Travail knowing that Anne-Lise Debout of the Gazette had kept a place for me beside her for that so we can have a transcript and a video backup the entire conference Periscope
 And take the opportunity to take some pictures for the Gazette as well
 I found it - TF1 be relevant now
 Knowing that he would have transcribed a small part of what was said
 Also as I said in the previous message each time Periscope little has nearly 300 subscribers around we are 5 to be rather permanently in place for 3 weeks
 Place 5 x 300 it would have added 1,500 people to the conference when there was already no room in it would have been pretty well do not you think? I can not blame anyone obviously security question can not put more than one person can hold in a room
 There is only one hour Periscope who managed to get in and could not filmed everything that's why it's interesting when we are many that avoids the technical problems that prevented transcribe all of what we filmed
 That said I do not know if we can find the video on Dailymotion I saw that there was a link to a live transcript 
 if only we had more to have it before sending any fees Piscope viewer on this link
 Maybe we should mind for the next time if there are other conferences whether here or elsewhere in France where in the world can be in French or English maybe we should think about redo transcribed live on the site with a video projector would allow the greatest number to enjoy it and hesitate disappointment of hundreds and hundreds of people who could not go to the conference today at the Labour Exchange
Other than that the concert of the Standing Louis Orchestra was magnificent tonight I hope that they will very quickly it was a success on the incredible site and on social networks too!
Have a good night and thank you for your investment later; )

Before, each family was protecting the disabled, elderly and its enfants
Ne speak no religion, it has been distorted by people who wanted the true religion pouvoir
Aimons us the other one with our differences fruiting can be for the good of all
So, do not talk about the Ten Commandments, speaks of constitution ^^

isabelle: No it's not every family to take care of its old, and children, and the disabled
 A disabled without family, you let him die in his corner? Solidarity and pooling against the risk are only effective at large scale
 It is the society that has to do it
 So no, it's not easy to organize
 So no, the simplification is not a solution
Prefer reformulation rather than begin a sentence no
 After reading previous posts I think cybergrunge, tribut
isabelle and I are totally in phase

The Ten Commandments better replay: it is largely a call to religious intolerance and patriarchy 1 1
And I'm sure they have not been debated in committee or voted in AG
I personally found the interventions of Lordon and Ruffin but not much more
"Last night in the dung of work, the commission" convergence of struggles "Night Stand (Paris and others) supported by the newspaper Fakir (So Franis Ruffin) organized a discussion evening" Night Stand and after "?
The choice of each word in my sentence is important
The struggles Convergence Committee can not lay claim representative standing nights
 There are many other emotions standing in the nights that are not found in these discourses
 Think of it as a group of common will that formed through, or within, "Night Stand"
 Night stand has allowed these people to recognize and begin to move in the same direction
 But the nights standing enable many more people to recognize themselves around topics and others to move in other directions
This preamble past I invite you to listen Lordon who (in my opinion) well represents the will of political affirmation, constitution movement, active citizenship and marked orientation
Much of what he says can be cleaving
com/576030965833088/videos/690448501058000/?video_source=pages_finch_thumbnail_video
We regularly and continuous debate in Nice
 And I think it should be defined as Night Stand is NOTHING but allows ALL
 It is a place of encounter and exchange which in itself may appear as the "soft citizenism, not giving birth in either useless" but actually allows the emergence of hard citizenism movements such as the commission convergence of struggles which to here
 Set night standing by the action or the will of some of its committees would be simplistic
Ruffin and also because it is funny
com/576030965833088/videos/690456741057176/?video_source=pages_finch_main_video
And I'll wait for the full report of this discussion evening because it's generally the direction I would like to take personally
 The direction of the hard citizenism
Fric Lordon to Labour Exchange April 20, 2016 "Night Stand: The Step of after?"
tonight at the Bourse du Travail: "NuitDebout: Step Apres" Franis Ruffin "take our oath, we will never vote PS"
sorry, "dung of work" was not voluntary
 Some will see the slip they vondront 1
@ Billy-Pierre-Yves: I sign: o) or hobbes nor Lenin
@ Billy Pierre Yves If I rephrase, you consider that ND is - nothing less - a reappropriation of movement of political power by the citizens
I think that any definition of Night Stand is doomed to failure empirical
Well, we will learn from our mistakes This is the normal world that tries to label the thing
 But the thing is resistant to all its labels
By cons, initiatives are born in Night Labelled standing
 Convergence Committee struggles Lordon and Ruffin is etiquetable
 But this is not (in the sense of strict equality) night standing
labels, and boxes to better divide the world, to cram as a psychotic collector, no thank you
The labels, it is sometimes useful to know if you are allergic to any of the components The labels used primarily to identify and provide support for reflection
 Night Stand is a label for example
((Label the sense of a scientist, after may be for literary we have different interpretations of the concept of labels
Always it is that it is important to ask the question of what we can be for ND
labels to think about the world? divide, divide, thinking the world is to accept diversity, to accept that everything changes all the time, that's life
 How many labels are outdated after being asked? There 'are the dead which change pluis
If ND is my politicization tool, I will come there with reflection, reference documents and pen paper
By cons, if ND Repub is for me a base to launch before punch operations in Paris (as manifest in St Lazare), I'm not going back with my trowel and my tulip bulbs
 Language is the first of the sets of labels, and he seems to have found some use
punctuality tool, local and temporary
 And in the nebulae are born stars
 Regardless of any individual or collective will of the cloud or dust
Truth does not exist, there are only local and temporary truths
And if one is afraid of the stars
@LoGduPerigord: Good, we do nothing more then?
And there are other possible interpretations of ND
 It is necessary to be a piecemeal interpretation - and thus probably false - for reasoning about objects that are beyond us (and beyond us because ND multi polar, decentralized, organic, high spatio temporal evolution)
After so do not be mistaken, and please do not try to interpret a plot plausible interpretation as the only possible
 ((That TF1 is interpreting as a ND breakers flock puisance))
no, that's not what I say, to understand the complexity of the world, it is necessary before accepting
Accepeter that everything changes all the time
But rationalize by labeling, not simplify the world
In any case it depends on the motivation of the labeler is 
as well as the elementary and universal wisdom
Yes and his look, everything is relative to your eyes
((I have described here using a nomenclature in the scientific world, and it is in this sense that I think important, and trying to "label" Night Stand
If you put a label, you can also start thinking

c is just the problem of the Western citizen crazy, he believed that it was beyond the 
each in its spatiotemporal marks, experiences, actions, p
our judging by labeling except to position themselves in relation to them
the truth, it exists in the heart of man, c is just the western human who Mala let his heart 
Western or not, the exsites facts, truths exist, the only truth is an illusion an ideal that he did plsu does not exist
 The perfect, the ideal does not exist, the empty words where anyone is put anything
You will not find to let speak the human heart not only beautiful things

 To think, we must first define pins that go into my eyes ENTERING AND accpetant their limitations and non-absolute sides
Hello to all s-if we want to put labels, the labor exchange could be called the commission "step by short-term" vision collect short-term and longer term can be complementary they have the same enemy, a minimum common struggle against the capitalist system
fakirpresse's home for videos and live streams on Dailymotion
it means the idea belongs to Fakir
This is an accusation that could be called label
 neither sees nothing but a conclusion, I dab in Fakir

Wednesday, April 20 at 19:00 Fakir & convergence commission struggles / discussion evening on "The step from" LIVE
The Republic Square is filled, and Night standing swarmed in Province and even abroad
 But should we be content? Fakir and commission convergence of struggles invite to a discussion evening on "The step from" Wednesday, April 20 at 19h at the Labour Exchange in Paris
commisiopn copnvergencs the struggles did not practically speaking, he was there in decor
I just watched the intervention of Lordon yesterday
 To my mind for action and the short term, ND must go in the direction that develops Lordon (actually he did not invent anything, it serves as spokesman - and reminder - a thought that floats in thought collective)
 I love the idea of ??restoring the sand
However, to prepare for the post output of the frame and prevent the short-term actions ND being recovered, it must be done background work in the short term is unnecessary and may seem a kind of debate to debate but that its importance if we are to reach a governance without elites
 ((But Lordon supports only the first project because it has long studied for its implementation, while the project of a horizontal governance I doubt there is much thought, and so I understand it does not take position above
Lordon key anyway a crucial point, as we have not put a bag the neoliberal system and its grip finaciere the entire society, all other claims will be only the pavers into the pond, and the worst is that even this is below those that cleave us
 I'm not saying that we must put aside these various claims, but must stop to take the cabbage is whether one is willing to defend this or that idea, a particular mode of action, we must begin to hit all overall, in every sense, to bring harm to a system which urges us all like lemons and never recede malgres few social or political victories we can win here and the
 And if we manage to tap international treaties, and even one little eroded the power of the lobbies of finance and shareholding, then it will both offer on the table all these claims that emerge any Azimute ND
 and ask that the debate is inevitable and it must prepare on, but never close doors
 This debate is of course, what society do we want for tomorrow? But if one succeeds in not opening the breach, this debate is particularly steriile and cleaving
Either way ND is a collection of divisions, but before we dissociate, we stand in solidarity to fuck this system in the air or at least begin to give critical hits

 but ND Lille, the question was in thorny AG, or not solidarity with the comrades of CNT arrested 
 In other words, if a fellow ND embarked soon, it is a support which refliechira twice before to move
 Is this what we want? See meme, part of ND will simply stop coming Sated Lille has to put a contribute to the CNT and start fighting in his corner

Lille: What? The police broke into the premises of the CNT to just a stone history that flew in a window ?? I'm the one that the disproportionate reaction of shock?
you know it's every day that police strike steals breaks and doing illegal things but yes it is shocking, like every day
It is also they who handles the problems of aggression, etc 
You have very lucky if you never had to turn you to the police for help
@Yannou: I do not usually for me every day and these are revelations
So you're jaded it scares me that I will discover tomorrow
besancon: basically there are two types of people, those for whom the police are protection / support, and those for whom it is a daily oppression
I doubt if you ask for a "young commuter" if the cops reassure him or do fliper he tell you that they are there to help
in my case, being super white and privileged, I have too much trouble with the cops and jsuis quite certain that if something goes wrong they would protect me
but for others it is not at all the case, and it's pretty outrageous
@diego I am jaded by what I see in the press and that the comrades tell me, but I have not experienced myself, I had this chance
@Yannou: I must be too good next time, because to me these people are doing their work, they are not perfect, they are human
And they vote more than 50% for the FN
 For some people this is clearly institutionalized oppression
It really is you think? Can you tell me more? because yes, there are rotten but of a institutionalized say it is I do not see the link
It's never easy to get a realistic idea, especially if like me you life in a medium sized city
 Also be aware that we communicate much more about the negative sides of their actions on the positive side
There were articles recently on the harassment of the cops in some neighborhoods
fr/paris-75/paris-18-ados-portent-plainte-pour-violences-policieres-18-12-2015-5385327

speaking of the joint Police / justice and injustice resulting
and then you're well known in the control facies, when you is not got the right color're often checked several times a day
Yes, but do not make generalization in my opinion, these neighborhoods are disadvantaged areas, both for the population and for the cops who work there
 More difficult the conditions are more error are large and numerous
bah it is certain that in these neighborhoods, people are really mistreated by police
in the 16th it did not happen like that it is easy to get used to this kind of problems, saying "conditions are difficult" but I think we must continue to denounce the still
 But I also like that the intuition in these qurtiers there in the most violence and drugs etc 
Yes, we must denounce you're right But do not fall into the Heine of the police force in generalizing
The cops, there are good and less good, as everywhere, against the orders they receive are given by head that up to the goodwill of the hierachy
 And when the hierachy covers this kind of behavior, we are entitled to be angry, it would even make a little more than indignation
These "leaders" are set up by the government, which set him up during democratic elections 
 so for us it is clear that we must do more than be indignant
we must also consider the fact that the police lack the means to conduct effective policies, particularly in neighborhoods
 At one time, there was a real community police, who knew the residents and young people growing up knowing the officers
 It did not avoid clashes, but there was a mutual respect
 Today, that community policing has been completely dismantled in the name of efficiency, and we see what happens 
yes, and policies of dismantling proximity fonts are also denouncing
Denounce easy, rebuild together is more complicated
suddenly, the police are also oppressed workers by their hierarchy, the "good" no longer have room to do their job (long investigations, little return in terms of arrest, but of dismantling the networks above), and the bad are brought to the pinnacle because they make the figure (as they simply stop pawns)
@ Philippe151101: we can not be agreements ^^ but to rebuild something solid, you still have to identify what doesnt It really hurt actually, it parrait yet evident that a police closer to the people would be more efficase
besancon: I remind you that the police are part of the population ^^

 they put up a good subculture enter them ^^^
And that is more or like moin in the armed
I think the majority of people of ND are more or less agree with these findings
 What is forgotten is that governments are not REALLY elected by the people but by the media that tell us who we should or should not elect
 And the media, are held by the same operating throughout the society, far from our small daily preocuapations
 When the capital police say, which is a somewhat easy shortcuts, it's still a bit in the vrai
Car the state is the state capital
 Although the pilociers as individuals do not condone, in their own way, just as we all do, they participate
Yes, it reveint as much debate in the democratic debate Operates in our society
Lille: quite, because as many people say "he must live" and to live in the present system, it takes money, and therefore a job 
 and so people n 'have more choice, either the workers or the police
Lille: And even if the media did not do what pre choice, elections are not democratic
 Since it is enough to change the voting system to change the elected
Lille: Clearly we are all more less chained in this system, and even those who refuse are chained in their opposition to this system, but I think we begin to understand all that little act together
 When will the police in the street with young people and the unemployed, and workers to denounce the same pressure that undergoes all the walking or creve it enough
Lille: as I said several people, including RG and CRS, my wish is that the police come to speak personally to the platform that is available to every citizen by NuitDebout 
 good they replied me that they have the duty of confidentiality (what I expected) but the intention is there   1 1
you have the small icon of the toothed wheel, you click and you selects your icon
(A right time to post the message)
Yes, but I do not have this icon?
@diego: And that's why, even as I am very anxious to see a true convegence struggles, and the chapel of debates and discuss around a new Consitution 50 parraissent a little frivolous for the time
 I think that it is important to start thinking about it all the same
 To have things to bring to the table when discussing the balance of power has changed
the wheel appears highlighted when you pass over
((It's still a sacred shit reserve duty
 I feel nowadays it is used as a means to prevent any protest of minor officials (for education that prevents teachers denounce some shameful methods to raise the numbers of the tray for example)
 It is what it normally reserve duty?))
besancon: you can also click on a icon to add already has the same
it serves to keep out the forces of doing politics
reserve duty, discretion and secrecy in public service | service-public
Officials and non-permanent staff are subject to reserve duty
 This requirement concerns the mode of expression of opinions and not their content
 It more or less severe depending on the context and the place of the agent in the hierarchy
 Officials and non-permanent staff are also subject to the discretion and secrecy professionals
@ Pixocode-dev-Lyon: ok, it's good to know ^^
Thank you, I just see how show all smileys
Lille: 50 we can already agree on a broader project to present to others
It seems to me that the shared-vision cat responds to it 
I do not think the same small group reflection will serve to anything, one must also say that PLUSIEUR small group can converge to the same proposals
 But suddenly it's not the duty of confidentiality that prevents peacekeepers from participating / ND testify outside their service
To address the bottom melts to agree on the shape of our values ??
 and the police can participate in this reflection
@diego: "The reserve requirement applies during and timeless service
"Any public official must exercise restraint and measured in the oral and written expression of his personal views
"This obligation does not concern the content of opinions (freedom of opinion is known to public officials), but their mode of expression
and even: "This obligation continues to apply to suspended officers of their duties and availability
ie a vacancy agent is still subject to duty reserve 
besancon, and it must be done, but do not believe either that good ideas will solve everything, There are plenty of good ideas, and they are not always new
 It is also the strength of the power to impose a discution on the public debate
 I am not certain that ND or bf very effective on this point
 Although there is some talk about the revenue base / Universal / wage life right now
 And I think it's related to noise that ND is everywhere
besancon: To support your words was the example of standing charter are several versions were written more or less independent and are all on the same line of thought
basically, they have the right to have opinions, not to express them
@diego: yes thank you, it's exatement this kind of example I was thinking
"This obligation does not concern the content of opinions" 
@diego: basically, they have the right to have opinions, not publicly express
Yes and no, basically it's think what you want, but do not express your opinions in the guise of an authority figure
test and expresses opinions respectfully of your function and others
they always have the right to express their opinion through the vote
It's a good thing after me the obligation of reserve police
(This thing that in the present state no longer serves the function it should fulfill ^^)
besancon: to some extent yes, but if an officer can not criticize the mode of operation of its external service because of reserve duty, and that despite its internal alarms nothing changes, then where will the public service? dale in the water 
Haha, I see that you no longer believe in the vote, personally I do not think it's corronpu it counts the votes correctly, and you have the right to vote for any candidate
After if people are manipulated by the media, by their spouses and others it's the same context
